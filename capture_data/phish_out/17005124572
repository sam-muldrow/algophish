			<div class="home-entry-content">
				<p>At Cash Now, in only five minutes you can have your loan request information reviewed by our large network of lenders and other third-party networks of lenders so they can choose whether to offer you a loan. Whether there is an emergency situation or you just need some extra funds and cannot wait until your next payday, an online payday loan is the perfect solution for you. Submitting a request for an online loan is fast, easy and painless. If you receive and accept a loan offer, money can be transferred to your checking account as soon as the next business day.</p>
				<p>If we are not able to find a lender in our network or in one of the other third-party lender networks we use that’s willing to offer you a loan, we may show you ads for other lenders or connect you with offers for debt relief, credit repair, or other credit-related products or services. This is not part of your loan request process. You are under no obligation to accept their offers and you should carefully review their offers to you and compare them to other options available to you before accepting.</p>
<p>Cash Now is the premier loan request service for online cash loans to US residents. If you are approved by one of the lenders or lending partners in our network, you can get money deposited to your bank account as soon as the next business day!</p>

<div id="lowercontent"><p><strong>APR – Explanation</strong></p><p>
The annual percentage rate (APR) is the annualized interest rate that you are charged on a cash loan. Cash Now does not function as a lender and does not provide cash loans to consumers, but it does pass your information on to the lenders and lending partners in our network that may be able to offer you a loan. Cash Now never charges any fees for this service. Since it is not a lender, Cash Now cannot supply you with the specific APR that your lender will attach to your loan. Understand that APRs can vary based on the information that you supply in your cash loan request, as well as the information that your lender supplies to you.</p><p>Your lender will give information on the APR, finance charges and other applicable loan terms to you at the point when you get redirected to your loan agreement during the loan request process. If you require assistance with Cash Now–related services of any sort, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@cashnow.com">support@cashnow.com</a>.</p>
<p>
A cash loan’s APR can generally range from 240 percent to 2,340 percent, with the specific figure depending on how the rate is calculated and additional variables such as the duration of the loan, any fees that are incurred (late fees, nonpayment, etc.), and loan renewal specifics. Be aware of the fact that the APR range is different from your finance charge. Your lender will disclose the finance charge during the loan process.
</p>
<p>
<a id="sticky">
An informational example of a loan’s APR range is as follows:
</a>
</p>
<div id="apr-tip"><a class="close" href="#"><img src="wp-content/themes/cashnow.com/images/close.png" alt="close" /></a>
<h4>YOU CAN BORROW <span style="color: #999999;">$500</span> FOR <span style="color: #999999;">14 DAYS WITH A $40-$80</span> LENDER CHARGE. YOUR ESTIMATED APR WILL BE BETWEEN 208 AND 417 PERCENT.*</h4>
<strong>Cash loans are fairly costly when you compare them with other loan types. You are advised not to use them as a long-term financial solution; rather, you should only take them out to deal with emergency situations.</strong>
<br />
*Calculation: (lender fee / loan amount) x (amount of days in a year / duration of the loan) x 100
Low End Calculation: ($40 / $500) * (365 days / 14 days) x 100 = 208.57 percent
High End Calculation: ($80 / $500) * (365 days / 14 days) x 100 = 417.14 percent

<span class="apr-tip"></span>

<!-- end #lowercontent -->

</div>
<div id="lowercontentI"><p><strong>Important Implications to Consider</strong></p>
By law, lenders are required to supply customers with complete, detailed information on loan terms and conditions prior to those customers’ accepting a specific loan offer. It is advisable for you to always closely and carefully examine the terms of any loan offer that you receive. If you would like to see further details regarding the aforementioned considerations, see our <a href="/rates-fees">Rates &amp; Fees</a> section on this website.</p>
<!-- end #lowercontentI --></div>
<div id="notaccordion">
<h3><a href="#">Financial implications (Interest and finance charges)</a></h3>
<div>
<p class="tabalign">Should you receive approval for a cash loan, your lender will let you know about the specific interest rate and fees that are attached to the loan before you proceed with formally accepting their offer. As previously noted, Cash Now is not a lender, and because of this, it cannot predict the interest and fees that will be part of your loan offer. Please keep in mind that under no circumstances whatsoever are you ever obligated to accept any offer that you may receive.</p>

</div>
<h3><a href="#">Implications of non-payment</a></h3>
<div>
<p class="tabalign">When you accept a particular loan offer’s terms and conditions, you are formally agreeing to pay back the loan principal amount and finance charges in the period of time specified in your loan documents. Additional charges may apply if you are not able to pay back your loan completely or if you make a payment that is late. Cash Now is unable to predict the fees or charges that you will incur due to partial payment, nonpayment or late payment. Furthermore, Cash Now has no control at all over knowledge of the loan details between your lender and you.</p><p>
Be sure to refer to the late payment, partial payment and nonpayment policies you will find detailed in the loan documents that come from your lender.</p>

</div>
<h3><a href="#">Potential impact to credit score</a></h3>
<div>
    <p class="tabalign">Here at Cash Now, it is our policy to never get involved with making credit decisions or perform credit inquiries on potential borrowers. Some of the lenders in our network or in the other third-party networks we use may choose to perform a nontraditional credit inquiry so they can determine if you are eligible for a loan. Typically, these lenders will perform a credit check with any of the large U.S. credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion).</p>
    <p>Be aware that in the end, there is a chance that your credit score could be impacted by the actions of a particular lender. Should you fail to repay your loan on or before the specified due date, the lender may decide to report the delinquency to one or more of the aforementioned credit reporting agencies, possibly leading to your credit score being adversely affected. We encourage consumers with credit problems to contact a skilled credit counselor.
</p>

</div>
<h3><a href="#">Collection Practices</a></h3>
<div>
<p class="tabalign">Once again, Cash Now is not a lender, nor does it engage in debt collection activities. You will find in your lender’s loan documents information regarding their debt collection practices. Should you find that you are unsure of the collection practices that a particular lender uses, we advise you to discuss the matter with that lender. Cash Now is not an agent or representative of any of the lenders or lending partners in our network and we have no control over their actions.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="last"><a href="#">LOAN RENEWAL POLICIES</a></h3>
<div>
<p class="tabalign">Before you accept a loan offer, the lender will offer you loan renewal options. Make sure you carefully examine their renewal policy prior to signing any loan documents. Please be aware that, to a great extent, state regulations govern renewal policies.</p><p>
The intention is for cash loans to be used only as a short-term financial instrument. At Cash Now, we strongly advise all borrowers to pay back their loan in full and on or before the due date in order to avoid nonpayment and/or late fees. If you are of the belief that you may have trouble paying off a cash loan after borrowing it, we recommend that you explore different loan alternatives before submitting a request for a loan via this website.</p>

<p><strong>We are paid by Lenders, Lender Networks and other Advertisers:</strong> CashNow.com offers a free, for-profit, advertiser-supported loan connecting service to consumers. Lenders in our network and other third-party lender networks we use pay us if a lender offers you a loan after reviewing your information through our service. Many factors impact which lender we connect you with, but how much the lender or an intermediary third-party lender network pays us has a big impact.  We often use a “ping-tree” model similar to Google AdWords to connect the highest bidder to a consumer. So, if you receive a loan offer, it is likely from the highest bidder and not from the lender offering the best loan terms. Always review all options available to you and never assume a loan offer you receive is the best loan offer available to you. We also get paid by other advertisers in other ways.
