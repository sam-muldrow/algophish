I do not think just reading the BOK and learning it would’ve been enough. There were so many little tips, connections, memory hooks, and needed concept instruction and information that you provided that one cannot get from just reading/studying a book!
I did everything you said and covered every module and practice exam - some twice!! The test taking strategies were by far the most helpful especially the ASQ Value System one!!

I just wanted to thank you again for your online CSQP certification training.

                                    <ol>
                                        
                                            <li>You instructor is friendly, educated, and have real- world quality engineering experience. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>Your instructor has been preparing students for the ASQ CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) exam for over 20 years. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>Your instructor has passed and gotten certified on 16 of the 19 ASQ exams. Nothing can take the place of experience! </li>
                                        
                                            <li>Your instructor has won the prestigious Shingo Award for research and publication.  </li>
                                        
                                            <li>From all this experience at taking ASQ exams we have created specific techniques that are unique to Alpha Superior Quality Training.  This information is contained in two lectures entitled “Test Taking Strategies”.  We will make you a test taking pro!  Before I created this material it took 5 hours for me to finish a 5 hour ASQ exam, however, after I discovered this technique I was able to finish the 5 hour exam in approximately 1 ½ hours and I aced it.  My record was finishing an ASQ exam in 30 minutes (and yes I aced it!).</li>
                                        
                                            <li>All of our lectures in the ASQ CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) test prep class are in HD video and may be watched over your mobile devices. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>Our class is published over an easy to use LMS (Learning Management System) that allows all the functionality needed for your successful ASQ CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) preparation efforts.</li>
                                        
                                            <li>The CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) prep class consists of 103 lectures that covers the ASQ CQE ( CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) BOK in an easy to understand and enjoyable format. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>Our CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) prep class uses approximately 1,000 test question associated with the lectures and over another 1,000 questions in our practice exams. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>10. Part of our ASQ CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) test prep uses the Indiana Quality Councils CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) primer.  After every chapter you read there are test questions that cover your reading assignment.  You instructor gives a lecture over half the questions, to explain the logic used in deriving the correct answer for the various questions, the other half is left for you to practice with.  On the mathematical chapters your instructor will work all problems at the end of those chapters.  You will listen to the solutions, turn off the video, and then work them on your own.  This makes it less painful to develop the skill you need to pass the ASQ CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) certification exam. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>After you finish all of the online training and the associated exams and finish reading the Primer we then have you take our practice exams.  We have 12 exams available but most students will take only three.  Once you experience an 80% rate, or above, on your practice exams you are ready for the ASQ CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) certification.  This is what we have learned from 20 years of experience in preparing students for the ASQ CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) exam. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>Our first time pass rate is over 90% compared to the general populations pass rate of approximately 58%.  The students that fail the exam, that have taken our class, are usually the ones that don’t finish all of the class requirements. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>We have the best guarantee in the industry.  We guarantee you will pass the ASQ CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) exam on the first try.  If you don’t pass on the first attempt we will pay for your retake.  If you don’t pass it on the second attempt we will pay for your third retake. If you fail the third time we will give you the rest of your money back minus the amount we paid for your retakes.  To qualify for this guarantee you must complete all class requirements.  To see class requirements press here:  You must listen to all lectures and take associated exams for those lectures.  You must finish all exams at a 75% or above. This shouldn’t be a problem as you are allowed to take practice exams before you take the real exam. You must also read the Primer and finish the questions at the end of each chapter, remember I go over half of these with you.  You must finish at least 4 practice exams and them take a series of final exams and finish these at over an 80%.  Finishing these requirements will qualify you for the guarantee. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>We present the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) material in a natural format, similar to how you work through a quality engineering project.  Other providers just simply review the BOK in an effort to get you through the exam.  Our objective is twofold, one objective is to get you to pass the ASQ CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) exam on the first try and the second objective is to educate you in such a way as to make you a powerful quality engineer that will allow you to advance your career. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>We use three publications to help you prepare for the ASQ CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) certification exam.  They include the online publications (lectures and exams), CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) Primer, Instructor Notes.  The Instructor Notes consists of hard copies of the online lectures.  The Instructor Notes have an appendix that have all applicable formulas in one place so you can look them up quickly and confidently.  We also have the complete BOK, at least the statistics elements, in flow charts.  Not all students use this as it can be somewhat overwhelming to some, however, if you like flow charts (memory maps) these will be invaluable.  These flowcharts contain all of the formulas with the assumptions and sometimes even example problems.</li>
                                        
                                            <li>You will be assigned a time where you can check into a live tutorial session. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>You will have one year access to your online account.  Obviously, most students dont need the whole year.  Most students will finish the ASQ CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) prep class in approximately 3+ months.  Most of our students are full time employees while preparing for the exam so the 3+ months is studying during evenings and weekends. </li>

                                    <p>I would recommend it.  You can take the exam without becoming a member of ASQ however it is more expensive to take the exam as a non-member.  The cost of taking the exam as an ASQ member is $398 and the cost as a non-member is $498 (save $100). The cost of joining ASQ is approximately $169.  So for an additional $69 you get all the benefits of being an ASQ member. </p>

                                    <p>The pass percentage varies from one exam to another.  CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) students all have the potential to take a different exam from one another.  I always tell my students if you can get an 80% you will pass, I have always found this to be true.  In reality the percentage is somewhere below 80% but fairly close to that standard.  ASQ will only show you the test results if you fail the exam.  Those that pass the exam are only told they passed but will not be given the percentage they achieved. Panels of experts examine every certification exam to ensure that the grading process provides an accurate assessment of a candidates proficiency. The experts establish the passing score for an exam and also use statistical analysis to make sure that different versions of an exam are equally challenging. ASQ certification exams use a &quot;cut-score&quot; process. You need a score of 550 points out of a possible 750 to be certified.</p>

Certification is a mark of excellence. It demonstrates that the certified individual has the knowledge to assure quality of products and services. Certification is an investment in your career and in the future of your employer. One of my students was recently looking for a new job without success.  This student decided to get the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) certification and after successfully taking the exam posted it on his resume and the next day got three calls for interviews and got several offers from those interviews.  The ASQ CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) cert is highly respected within industry.</p>

Prometric Test Center Administrators can provide you with a hand-held basic calculator upon request. With the introduction of tablets and palmtop computers and the increasing sophistication of scientific calculators, ASQ has become increasingly aware of the need to limit the types of calculators permitted for use during the examinations. Any silent, hand-held, battery-operated calculator with no programmable memory will be permitted. Programmable calculators tend to have graphing capabilities, the ability to store text/alphanumeric data by the input of the user, and a function (fn, F1, F2, etc.) button. Calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI-89 or similar are absolutely not allowed because they are programmable. The examination is written so that a simple calculator will be sufficient to perform all calculations. Examinees are allowed to have a backup calculator if necessary.</p>

                                            <li>Your instructor has passed and gotten certified on 16 of the 19 ASQ exams. Nothing can take the place of experience! </li>
                                        
                                            <li>Your instructor has won the prestigious Shingo Award for research and publication.  </li>
                                        
                                            <li>From all this experience at taking ASQ exams we have created specific techniques that are unique to Alpha Superior Quality Training.  This information is contained in two lectures entitled “Test Taking Strategies”.  We will make you a test taking pro!  Before I created this material it took 5 hours for me to finish a 5 hour ASQ exam, however, after I discovered this technique I was able to finish the 5 hour exam in approximately 1 ½ hours and I aced it.  My record was finishing an ASQ exam in 30 minutes (and yes I aced it!).</li>
                                        
                                            <li>All of our lectures in the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) test prep class are in HD video and may be watched over your mobile devices. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>Our class is published over an easy to use LMS (Learning Management System) that allows all the functionality needed for your successful CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) preparation efforts.</li>
                                        
                                            <li>The CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) prep class consists of 103 lectures that covers the CQE ( CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) BOK in an easy to understand and enjoyable format. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>Our CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) prep class uses approximately 1,000 test question associated with the lectures and over another 1,000 questions in our practice exams. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>10. Part of our CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) test prep uses the Indiana Quality Councils CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) primer.  After every chapter you read there are test questions that cover your reading assignment.  You instructor gives a lecture over half the questions, to explain the logic used in deriving the correct answer for the various questions, the other half is left for you to practice with.  On the mathematical chapters your instructor will work all problems at the end of those chapters.  You will listen to the solutions, turn off the video, and then work them on your own.  This makes it less painful to develop the skill you need to pass the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) certification exam. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>After you finish all of the online training and the associated exams and finish reading the Primer we then have you take our practice exams.  We have 12 exams available but most students will take only three.  Once you experience an 80% rate, or above, on your practice exams you are ready for the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) certification.  This is what we have learned from 20 years of experience in preparing students for the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) exam. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>Our first time pass rate is over 90% compared to the general populations pass rate of approximately 58%.  The students that fail the exam, that have taken our class, are usually the ones that don’t finish all of the class requirements. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>We have the best guarantee in the industry.  We guarantee you will pass the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) exam on the first try.  If you don’t pass on the first attempt we will pay for your retake.  If you don’t pass it on the second attempt we will pay for your third retake. If you fail the third time we will give you the rest of your money back minus the amount we paid for your retakes.  To qualify for this guarantee you must complete all class requirements.  To see class requirements press here:  You must listen to all lectures and take associated exams for those lectures.  You must finish all exams at a 75% or above. This shouldn’t be a problem as you are allowed to take practice exams before you take the real exam. You must also read the Primer and finish the questions at the end of each chapter, remember I go over half of these with you.  You must finish at least 4 practice exams and them take a series of final exams and finish these at over an 80%.  Finishing these requirements will qualify you for the guarantee. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>We present the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) material in a natural format, similar to how you work through a quality engineering project.  Other providers just simply review the BOK in an effort to get you through the exam.  Our objective is twofold, one objective is to get you to pass the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) exam on the first try and the second objective is to educate you in such a way as to make you a powerful quality engineer that will allow you to advance your career. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>We use three publications to help you prepare for the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) certification exam.  They include the online publications (lectures and exams), CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) Primer, Instructor Notes.  The Instructor Notes consists of hard copies of the online lectures.  The Instructor Notes have an appendix that have all applicable formulas in one place so you can look them up quickly and confidently.  We also have the complete BOK, at least the statistics elements, in flow charts.  Not all students use this as it can be somewhat overwhelming to some, however, if you like flow charts (memory maps) these will be invaluable.  These flowcharts contain all of the formulas with the assumptions and sometimes even example problems.</li>
                                        
                                            <li>You will be assigned a time where you can check into a live tutorial session. </li>
                                        
                                            <li>You will have one year access to your online account.  Obviously, most students dont need the whole year.  Most students will finish the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) prep class in approximately 3+ months.  Most of our students are full time employees while preparing for the exam so the 3+ months is studying during evenings and weekends. </li>

                                    <p>The pass percentage varies from one exam to another.  CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) students all have the potential to take a different exam from one another.  I always tell my students if you can get an 80% you will pass, I have always found this to be true.  In reality the percentage is somewhere below 80% but fairly close to that standard.  ASQ will only show you the test results if you fail the exam.  Those that pass the exam are only told they passed but will not be given the percentage they achieved. Panels of experts examine every certification exam to ensure that the grading process provides an accurate assessment of a candidates proficiency. The experts establish the passing score for an exam and also use statistical analysis to make sure that different versions of an exam are equally challenging. ASQ certification exams use a &quot;cut-score&quot; process. You need a score of 550 points out of a possible 750 to be certified.</p>

Certification is a mark of excellence. It demonstrates that the certified individual has the knowledge to assure quality of products and services. Certification is an investment in your career and in the future of your employer. One of my students was recently looking for a new job without success.  This student decided to get the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) certification and after successfully taking the exam posted it on his resume and the next day got three calls for interviews and got several offers from those interviews.  The CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) cert is highly respected within industry.</p>

                                    <p>I recommend the TI-30XA.  This calculator will offer everything you need to pass the CQE (CERTIFIED QUALITY ENGINEER) certification exam.  I will also teach you how to use this calculator though out the instructional material. All computer-based exams feature a basic scientific calculator on-screen in the exam. Prometric Test Center Administrators can provide you with a hand-held basic calculator upon request. With the introduction of tablets and palmtop computers and the increasing sophistication of scientific calculators, ASQ has become increasingly aware of the need to limit the types of calculators permitted for use during the examinations. Any silent, hand-held, battery-operated calculator with no programmable memory will be permitted. Programmable calculators tend to have graphing capabilities, the ability to store text/alphanumeric data by the input of the user, and a function (fn, F1, F2, etc.) button. Calculators such as the Texas Instruments TI-89 or similar are absolutely not allowed because they are programmable. The examination is written so that a simple calculator will be sufficient to perform all calculations. Examinees are allowed to have a backup calculator if necessary.</p>
