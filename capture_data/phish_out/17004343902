This means that almost one in ten people are experiencing frequent and often debilitating panic/anxiety attacks. Anyone can experience panic attacks and they often start for reasons which aren't obvious. Symptoms include racing heart, lightheadedness, shakiness, dry throat, sweating, nausea and feelings of intense fear or impending doom. Typically when they first occur you worry that you might be going crazy, losing control, having a heart attack/stroke, or that you wont be able to breathe. It's important to know that none of  these things can happen as a result of panic attacks no matter how strongly it may feel like it. The good news about panic attacks is that they are often completely curable  typically without the need for medication.  Correctly designed and implemented Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) treatment programs of between eight and sixteen consultations have been  demonstrated to achieve an elimination of panic attacks in up to 94% of cases. <span class="subheader-blue"><a href="pd.htm" class="subheader-blue">More........</a></span> </p>

A diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is typically given when a person experiences panicky feelings when in social settings or attempting to enter social settings. Symptoms can include blushing or fear of blushing (erythrophobia), heart racing, shakiness, feeling sick on the stomach, lightheaded and sweaty palms. Often excessive sweating can become the principal concern of those experiencing social anxiety perhaps leading to a diagnosis of hyperhydriosis. Cognitive behaviour therapy has been well evidenced to provide significant relief of social anxiety symptoms. <span class="subheader-blue"><a href="sad.htm">More..... </a></span></p>

The principal symptom of GAD is persistent intrusive thoughts and worry often leading to feeling panicky and ultimately depressed and/or fearful that you will lose control and do something that you don't want to do. Usually we are able to dismiss our worries without too much difficulty, but if GAD develops worries persistently re-appear causing intense frustration and anxiety. When this occurs trying to push away worries through techniques such as distraction often only makes the anxiety worse. Fortunately having the right information and using the right strategies to fight the symptoms of GAD can provide long lasting relief. <span class="subheader-grey style6"><a href="gad.htm" class="subheader-blue">More.....</a></span>                  </p>

This does not mean that you have depression. People who have depression almost constantly feel down for long periods of time and this interferes significantly with their daily lives. Depression changes how you act, think and feel and typically results in you having little or no energy or motivation to get up and on with your day. A little recognised fact about depression is that most people who have it have been experiencing strong anxiety for some time and the anxiety has directly contributed to the onset of the depression. When this is the case successfully treating the anxiety typically results in full recovery from the depressive symptoms&nbsp; </span></span><span class="subheader-blue"><a href="dep.htm">More.....</a></span></p>

When obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) develops these routines become excessive, typically being repeated more often and for a longer period of time than necessary. Often routines develop that would not usually be necessary at all, but typically, despite knowing this, you still feel compelled to repeat them until you can feel comfortable. At any given time OCD is thought to affect around 2.5% of the population although recent findings have indicated that this figure may be even higher. OCD can develop in both children and adults alike <a href="ocd.htm" class="subheader-blue">More......</a></p>

The person may have experienced the traumatic event directly or they may have witnessed it.  People who suffer from PTSD typically experience intense emotional distress when recalling traumatic memories or when exposed to situations that are similar to the traumatic event&nbsp; <span class="subheader-blue"><a href="ptsd.htm">More.....</a> </span></p>

Social anxiety (or excessive shyness) and obsessive compulsive disorder, for example, can occur in children as young as five. Excessive fear of being separated from parents or caregivers (known as separation anxiety disorder) can occur at even younger ages. Despite the media focus on other issues, recent studies have shown that anxiety disorders are&nbsp; present in as many as 24% of children and teens making it a far more common problem than mood disorders (7%) disruptive disorders (8%) and substance abuse (4%). If left untreated childhood anxiety disorders often lead to the development of ongoing difficulties in many areas of adult  life. <span class="subheader-blue"><a href="child.htm">More.....</a></span></span></p>

The primary symptoms of a specific phobia involve feeling intense fear/panic when near the feared object or situation.  Specific phobias can usually be successfully treated using brief behaviour  therapy <span class="subheader-grey style4"><a href="sp.htm" class="subheader-blue">More..... </a></span></p>

Not all therapists or treatments are the same and some are more effective than others. Recent developments in anxiety and depression treatment has brought essential new understandings which until recently went largely unrecognised. For example a problem termed 'relaxation induced anxiety' can make it virtually impossible for relaxation techniques to assist in the long term alleviation of anxiety disorders. In fact attempting relaxation techniques in these cases tends to make anxiety worse, only relieving symptoms temporarily at best by distracting your mind. In these cases an effective alternative treatment is indicated <span class="subheader-blue"><a href="helpforanxiety.htm">More.....</a></span> </p>
