					<h3>When you make $100,000+ a year as an <span class="red">affiliate marketer</span>,<br />
you never have to worry about money ever again!</h3>
<div class="grid_7 rightcolumn push_3">
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Dear Reader:</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest problem facing newbie Internet marketers today is: “Where am I going to get products to sell?”</p>
<p>If you choose to be an information marketer, you’re faced with the daunting task of writing a 60-page e-book &#8230; producing an audio CD album &#8230; or recording a professional-looking video.</p>
<p>But the fact is, you can get started in Internet marketing — and even make a six-figure income online — without creating or having any products of your own!</p>
<p>How? By finding products your audience would like &#8230; and offering them to your e-list as an “affiliate” of the manufacturer or publisher.</p>
<p>In an affiliate arrangement, you could arrange to sell my e-books to your list of online subscribers. I’ve already done the work of writing, editing, and designing them.</p>
<p>On each sale, we’d split the take: I’d pay you 50% of the cover price, and I would keep the other 50% as my profit.</p>
<p>So if you sold 100 e-books at $39 each, your take would be $1,950.</p>
<p>And you get that with no labor on your part: the publisher is the one who creates the landing page &#8230; collects the payments online &#8230; writes you a check &#8230; produces and delivers the e-book &#8230;processes refunds.</p>
<p>As the affiliate, all you do, other than send an e-mail to your list offering the product, is sit back and collect the checks. You don’t need a product, a shopping cart, or even a merchant account. There’s no product delivery or customer service.</p>
<p>Internet marketing superstar Jeff Walker says: “Almost all the online entrepreneurs I know got their start as an affiliate.”</p>
<p>Affiliate marketing can help you make money in another way, too: let’s say you do create an information product. But you have a tiny or nonexistent e-list and very little web traffic. You can go to people with busy web sites &#8212; and big mailing lists &#8212; and invite them to sell your product to their customers as your affiliate.</p>
<p>You don’t pay any fee for the privilege. If they decide to promote your product to their list, they do it for free.</p>
<p>So how do they make money? From the affiliate commission! You pay them a percentage of the gross (usually 50% on e-books) for every product they sell.</p>

<h4>My readers say it best!</h4>
<p>&#8220;You are awesome! I will always come to you first for the products that I need. You have class, integrity, brilliance, naturally gifted, and you are second to none! I am impressed with and appreciate your prompt response.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Adella Pugh</p>
<p>&#8220;Once in a blue moon, you get the chance to meet a living legend, one of the great men who has shaped his chosen field. In my unending pursuit of powerful marketing, I came face-to-face with just such a man. Robert Bly is America&#8217;s Top Copywriter and a genius marketer. He&#8217;s authored over 70 books for McGraw Hill and others, and gets paid more per word than nearly every author in America. Like all great men, he is a teacher and mentor extraordinaire. He freely shares the secrets of turning marketing into money.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Dick Larkin</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob, your stuff is always so good that even though I&#8217;m retired now, I have to read it!&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Gary Bencivenga</p>
<p>&#8220;You are someone I&#8217;ve grown to admire greatly. You share your knowledge with and encourage people in achieving their dreams, trying new things, and learning tricks of the trade. It&#8217;s a rare &#8216;guru&#8217; in our world today who is thoughtful and kind enough to help up and comers find the path to success. In my opinion, you are the very best. I&#8217;m grateful to you.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Linda Capriotti</p>
<p>&#8220;During the past 20 years, Bob Bly has become one of  America&#8217;s leading direct response copywriters. He has probably done more to teach other writers the craft of effective and persuasive writing than anyone else.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Roger C. Parker</p>
<p>&#8220;After considering a number of high-level marketing professionals and reflecting on the matter for several weeks, I made the decision to ask Bob Bly to share the stage with me for my Twin Keys to Wealth-Building Conference. The reason I chose Bob is because I am convinced that he can deliver more tangible value to conference attendees than any other marketing or Internet expert on the planet.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Robert Ringer, best-selling author</p>
<p>&#8220;I have huge admiration for your work. You&#8217;re one of the few guys out there selling real information &#8212; and selling it at a reasonable price! I think what you&#8217;re doing is head and shoulders above others.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Mark Joyner</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, the product promos you&#8217;ve been sending have plenty of content. I look forward to your e-mails, because they are great idea generators. When an e-mail marketing message from you comes in, I follow it to the pages and then read and digest the sales copy. That alone is a goldmine to me. I love your grounded hype-free style. People should just model your approach and they would be wealthier for it. Thanks a lot for all the good stuff you&#8217;ve created over the years.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Tom Varjan</p>
<p>&#8220;The products I&#8217;ve ordered from you have been so good I&#8217;ve recommended them to others [and] your price points are very reasonable. Thanks very much for the content, the lessons, and the model to follow.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Winnie Anderson</p>
<p>&#8220;I get great value from your free materials, so I have no problem with your commercial content coming to me too. I&#8217;ve also received good value from the products I have bought from you.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Helen Wilkie</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Palmer&#8217;s The Affiliate Marketing Handbook is excellent. It&#8217;s full of how-to, step-by-step information desperately needed by beginners eager to enter this win-win field.&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;I hired Bob on his reputation, and found it is well-deserved. His fact-finding process in preparation to write our copy was both painless and enlightening. The final deliverables were right on time as promised, and better than expected – which is saying a lot because my expectations were high. The first time I read his copy for our project, I literally got chills down my back – he nailed it the first time. Wow.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Dennis Rosenberg, VP Marketing, VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Bob Bly did an amazing job with our company brochure. We are very impressed with his capacity to learn our product and to write copy so clearly and pointedly. Bob Bly is a great marketing investment.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Michael Manoussos, Manhole Barrier Systems</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Great white paper! I&#8217;m in favor of the entire submission. Please congratulate Bob on a great effort.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Michael C. Howard, Chasm Recovery</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Your Tax Loopholes ad looked great and is performing very well. Thanks for the strong copy.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Brian Kurtz, Boardroom</em></p>
<p>&#8220;You did an excellent job. It&#8217;s been a pleasure working with you on this project.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Edward Brunet, Decatur Professional Development, LLC</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very, very much for doing such a great job on the ad. I was one of those folks who would read the ads in the DAK catalog by Drew Kaplan and this was as enjoyable for me as that.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Chris Pickering, MeritDirect</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Bob . . . Just got the copy and advertisement you did for my new book . . . It&#8217;s great! You are good! Great job . . . you have tremendous insights into what excites and what sells!&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Don Libey, Libey Incorporated</em></p>
<p>&#8220;In my opinion, you are the best copywriter in the software industry.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Judy MacDonald, Director of Marketing, Direct Response</em></p>
<p>&#8220;When I received the piece, I thought, I&#8217;ll have to skim over it now and read it later. But, once I started, I couldn&#8217;t stop! You did a GREAT job with Ken&#8217;s story. I love it. It kept me reading. I&#8217;m VERY pleased with it.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Craig Simpson, Ken Roberts Company</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Bob, It&#8217;s been a pleasure to work with you!!! Thank you so much! I&#8217;m very happy with the copy; I feel it will give me good results.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Alejandra P. Bigai, Romanicos Chocolate</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks again for a great job.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Davis Ross, Ross Advertising</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I just wanted to thank you again for the excellent work you did for us. You are the man and I can&#8217;t tell you how much I admired your approach and service. Although I&#8217;ve never worked with a copywriter before, I think you set the standard pretty high. I look forward to working with you again. You certainly have my vote for the next round!&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>DP Jovine, Tycoon Research</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Great job &#8211; I&#8217;m always amazed at how you can boil the complex down into simple terms. It flows very well.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Kyle Hodgens, Capital Financial Media</em></p>
<p>Thank you for the copy. I see why you&#8217;re the expert. It&#8217;s so simple, it&#8217;s brilliant.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Sau Hyoung Pak, Big Machine</em></p>
<p>&#8220;The radio spots are very well done. I am very impressed with your work and copywriting expertise. We will be making the changes to the print ad as you suggested. In the future we may work with you to design a totally new print ad. Again I&#8217;d like to say I&#8217;m impressed with your services. You were prompt, informative, and definitely know your stuff. We will be recommending you to others and doing repeat business.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Joshua Andrews, Health Solutions, LLC</em></p>
<p>&#8220;When people get to the promotion, the promotion has a good conversion rate. In one test, it actually had a 14% conversion to sale&#8230; can&#8217;t ask for much better than that.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>David Galland, Casey Research</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I loved the ad! I don&#8217;t see any reason for revision so I have already put through a check request for the balance I owe you on the ad. We are very excited about this one. I can&#8217;t wait to see how it does. Thanks so much!&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Alice Wessendorf, Agora Health Book</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I show off the work that we did on lead generation for negotiation &#8212; as well as the conversion program from HMCL &#8212; as big successes.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Paul Szymanski, Harvard Business School Publishing</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for being very instrumental on making the launch of the wealth management book such a resounding success. It was so successful that we had to request more copies.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;<em>Ingrid Boney, II</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Bob! You are awesome to work with.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Matt Morsa, Stock Secrets, Inc.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve spoken to a thousand copywriters over the years and Bob Bly is the best. He knows what he&#8217;s doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;<em>Joe Culotta, Natural Medicine Co.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy to report to you that your piece out produced the 4 other packages we tested against it. I want to talk to you about another project&#8230;.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Nick Roumi, Pacific Coast Funding</em></p>
<p>&#8220;This is an outstanding letter. Really nice work!&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Paul Szymanski, Harvard Business School Publishing</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Like the package &#8230; the tone &#8230; I think it&#8217;s excellent.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Bill Caskey, Caskey Sales Achievement</em></p>
<p>&#8220;We are very pleased with your copy approach because your copy seems to speak to the neurologist better than the copy in previous promotions. Moreover, your copy presses the sell better and more effectively. I really value your direct marketing copy capabilities and I&#8217;m thrilled to have you working with MedLink.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Jim Chacona, MedLink</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you for the hard work and energy you&#8217;ve poured into the Sinatra product package. You are a joy to work with.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Gail Diggs, Phillips Health</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks again&#8230; you did a great job.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Caleb Cherry, Capital Financial Media</em></p>
<p>&#8220;You are a genius! I rarely love copy this much from the get-go. You hit it on the head!&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Sara Pond, Nightingale-Conant</em></p>
<p>&#8220;The original ad insert of &#8216;Wall Street&#8217;s Loss is Your Gain&#8217; continues to kick butt &#8212; pulls 12 to 15 subscriptions a week. Not bad for a $500 investment made 5 months ago.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Charles Mizrahi, Stealth Stocks</em></p>
<p>&#8220;As a marketing professional, for 17 years I wrote my own promotional material. But I am not a professional copywriter. It wasn&#8217;t until I took my own advice that I started getting the results I deserved. With Bob Bly, I got what I wanted &#8211; in the promised time frame &#8211; with re-writes &#8211; and the results I wanted.  Thanks Bob!&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Mark Amtower, Amtower &amp; Company </em></p>
<p>&#8220;I found your ad copy compelling, powerful&#8230;even entertaining. You really communicated the &#8216;feel&#8217; of the message we are selling. Thanks for such great work, Bob!&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Ashley Earnhardt Aiken, Thomas Nelson Publishers</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Bob wrote the most ballsy ad in the history of Dynamic Changes and it set sales records this fall. People couldn’t stop themselves from responding.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Richard Scheffren, Dynamic Changes Hypnosis</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Last year you did all the copy on the What Would Jesus Eat brochure. It was wonderful and I believe is one of the reasons that the book continues to do so very well.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;<em>Pamela Clements, Thomas Nelson Publishers</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Your work for me is outstanding.&#8221;<br />
