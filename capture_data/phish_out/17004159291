(“<strong>All Affiliates</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>”) is excited to launch the All Affiliates affiliate program, which allows you, as a All Affiliates Affiliate (“<strong>Affiliate</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”)
the chance to offer access to the cutting-edge and innovative All Affiliates
Eligible Products and earn money at the same time, as further described
herein (“<strong>Affiliate Program</strong>”).  By becoming an Affiliate, you agree to these All Affiliates Affiliate Program Terms and Conditions (“<strong>Agreement</strong>”).<br>‍<br><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE:</strong>
THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN SECTION 17 BELOW.
EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION
CLAUSE, YOU AND DESCRIPT AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED
BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND DESCRIPT WAIVE ANY RIGHT
TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR
CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p><p class="p-security"><br></p><p class="p-security"><br></p><h2 class="display3">1. GETTING STARTED</h2><p class="p-security">Participating
in the All Affiliates Affiliate Program is easy! First, you have to apply to
our Affiliate Program by creating an account with us and filling out an
application here.
You must have a valid PayPal account for receiving payment.  By applying
to the Affiliate Program, you represent and warrant that you are at
least 18 years of age and you are not a resident of a country currently
under sanction by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which is subject
to change at any time. <br><br>After you complete the online
application, All Affiliates will review your application and, in its sole
discretion, may accept you as a All Affiliates Affiliate, which is based on
brand and demographic fit and shall be monitored on an ongoing basis.
 If All Affiliates chooses you as an Affiliate, then All Affiliates will provide an
email approval through the LinkMink platform.  Once approved, you will
access your account and be given a unique URL (“<strong>Unique URL</strong>”) to display on your website and social media channels as described in this Agreement.  <br>‍<br>All Affiliates
may re-evaluate your Affiliate status and reserves the right to
terminate such Affiliate status at any time, which shall take effect
immediately upon notice to you.<br><br></p><h3 class="display3">2.  ELIGIBLE DESCRIPT PRODUCTS & VALID PURCHASES </h3><p class="p-security">The “<strong>Eligible Products</strong>” you may earn a Commission on are:All Affiliates CreatorAll Affiliates Pro<br>Eligible
Products may be purchased in either a monthly or annual subscription.
Eligible Products never include any custom priced packages that are not
self-service. <br>‍<br>All Affiliates uses a third party service provider, LinkMink,
to track a customer from the first click of your Unique URL to the
purchase of an Eligible Product on the All Affiliates website.   You only earn
a Commission for a Valid Purchase of an Eligible Product by a New
All Affiliates Customer. “<strong>New All Affiliates Customer</strong>” means that the customer has never subscribed to use any All Affiliates products (whether or not Eligible Products) in the past. <br>‍<br>A “<strong>Valid Purchase</strong>”
means that a New All Affiliates Customer clicked on your Unique URL and
purchased a All Affiliates Eligible Product from descript.com (the “<strong>All Affiliates website</strong>”)
within 30 days of the first click of the Unique URL, and which has been
approved by All Affiliates.  This means that if someone clicks on your Unique
URL on day 1, but purchases an Eligible Product on day 32, then this is
not a Valid Purchase.  All Affiliates determines whether a purchase is a
Valid Purchase in its sole discretion, and has sole right to make
decisions if discrepancies in tracking exist.  <br>‍<br>You agree that
All Affiliates has the right to all tracking data that Affiliate gathers
through its participation in this Affiliate Program, which is tracked by
LinkMink.  <br><br></p><h3 class="display3">3. COMMISSION FEES</h3><p class="p-security">When a Referral makes a Valid Purchase, you will earn the Commission as outlined in this Agreement.  “<strong>Referral</strong>” shall mean a New All Affiliates Customer that has made a Valid Purchase. <br>‍<br>All Affiliates
Affiliates earn a standard commission rate of 15% of the Eligible
Products’ subscription sale price, subject to those deductions noted
below, for a term of no longer than 12 consecutive months from the
initial sale of the subscription for up to a total of $100,000 USD (“<strong>Commission</strong>”). 
No Commissions are paid on renewal terms. This means that if you sell
an Eligible Product annual subscription, you will receive a one-time
commission off the annual subscription price and no further commissions
from that Referral.  If you sell an Eligible Product monthly
subscription, then you may receive a Commission for consecutive monthly
renewals by such Referral for up to 12 months.  If your Referral
terminates that subscription at any point before the 12-month period,
then you will not receive any further commissions.   Once you reach
$100,000 in Commissions annually, you may no longer participate in the
Affiliate Program without our written consent. <br>‍<br>All Affiliates
reserves the right to change the Commission percentages immediately upon
written notice to you. In such case, the new Commission price shall
take effect immediately for any Referrals after the date of notice of
Commission price change.  Affiliates who have a high performance rate
may be eligible to earn a higher Commission rate, as determined by
All Affiliates in its sole discretion on a case by case basis. <br>‍<br>Commissions
are generally paid on the 15 th of the month for Valid Purchases made
the prior month, but there are exceptions to this timing and payment may
take up to 45 days from the end of the month in which the Referral made
a Valid Purchase.  You will need to create a PayPal account in order to
get paid your Commissions, and you agree to provide All Affiliates with your
PayPal account name and email or any other reasonably requested
information in order to facilitate payment to you. <br>‍<br>Deductions
against Commission: Commissions paid will exclude taxes, VAT, and other
applicable fees in connection with a sale. We reserve the right to
reverse Commissions due to returns, order cancellations, erroneous order
duplications or erroneous payments made to you. We also reserve the
right to defer or refuse Commissions for disputed orders or orders we
reject and cannot fulfill.  We reserve the right to refuse or reverse
Commissions in the event Affiliate is in breach of this Agreement.<br><br></p><h3 class="display3">4. PROMOTING DESCRIPT PRODUCTS</h3><p class="p-security">You must comply with the following requirements when promoting All Affiliates Eligible Products:<br>‍<br><strong>You may</strong>

The People behind All Affiliates:
The founders
After founding and leading the largest affiliate program, All Affiliates' founders decided to take part of the establishment of the next major global brands. Gathering minds, resources and strategic partners into this new venture has been a great challenge, but it is nothing compare to what will be achieved.
The team
We've built past successes on people's strength, reputation and expertise. We still believe in this philosophy and we've hired some of the brightest and most skilled affiliate managers to build and nurture relationships with affiliates.
The partners
Tapping into an already crowded market is always adventurous and challenging. As an affiliate program we must select the right partners who will on one hand provide the consumers with a quality and competitive product, and on the other hand, provide the affiliates marketers with a top notch marketing system and competitive and innovative revenue schemes.
We've gathered those resources around us, so you can enjoy smooth business relationships with us while providing quality programs to your consumers.
