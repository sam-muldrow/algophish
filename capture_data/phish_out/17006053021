<h3>About Deluxe International School </h3>
<p><span class="emph">Deluxe International school</span> was
founded in 2010, by a young mother who could not secure a place
for grade 1 for her daughter in any of the private schools of her
choice. It is a non-denominational, independent primary school
catering for pupils of various races, nationalities and
religions. It is a co-education school. The school is currently
housed in the residential area of Avondale, about 3 minutes away
from Avondale Shops. The school environment is not only clean but
safe and secure.</p>
<h3>Mission Statement</h3> <p>To provide unmatched and
unprecedented excellence in academic and psycho-social standards
of child education at an international level. <p>We endeavor to
produce refined social fits and sharp leaders who are nothing
short of champions. </p>
<h3>Vision</h3> 
<p>We aim to produce pupils with bankable
grooming that is in touch with world realities. We desire to
produce pupils whose confidence, wisdom and astuteness will make
a difference in whatever they endeavor to undertake in life. We
seek to provide a notably 'DELUXE' service beyond every parent's
wildest imagination by unlocking every child's potential. Purpose
We seek to minimize the hustle and stress associated with
enrolling a child in a good school by making our application
process simple and straight forward. We also seek to cater for
the migrant parent who usually finds it hard to enroll a child
into a good school regardless of his race, creed or country of
origin. We seek to create a school set-up that promotes unity in
diversity by encouraging tolerance and co-existence.</p></div>
