Consequently, cassava has been a leading food and industrial crop to boost up the rural economic in Lampung province. Harvesting areas for cassava in Lampung in 2014 was approximately 304,468 ha, mainly located in Middle Lampung, North Lampung, South Lampung, Way Kanan, dan Tulang Bawang. Unfortunately in Lampung, unlike in other commodities such as oil palm, pineapple and sugar cane, production technology applied to the cassava plant is not optimized yet.</p><p>In order to accommodate, disseminate, and share the results of research and development of various technologies related to cassava, Lampung University will hold an international seminar in November 2017.</p></div></div></div></div></div></p>
