Our big data capacity is amongst the biggest in the industry and our Timed Special Events feature, allowing in-game additions without the need for an update, is the envy of it. Most of our game engines, systems and platforms are built in-house too. We’re constantly inventing and reinventing. Questioning and challenging. But for all our progress, one key thing remains. Our games, made for adults, are free to play and engineered to bring joy. The way we see it, our users spend an average of 35 minutes a day playing our games.

We’ll then invite you to a second interview, possibly over the phone again or maybe face-to-face. It’s a chance for you to find out as much about us as we find out about you. Assuming you’re impressed with us and vice-versa, you may have a couple more interviews before we make a decision, and then, hopefully, an offer you can’t refuse.","jobsAnswer_10":"As always, do your research.

Paragraph 21 also applies to any Dispute between you and any King Affiliates, each of which is an intended third-party beneficiary of paragraph 21. For the purposes of paragraph 21, “Affiliate” shall mean any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with King, where ‘control’ means the direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of such entity’s capital or equivalent voting rights and “Dispute” shall include any dispute, claim, controversy or action between you and King (or any King Affiliates) arising out of or relating to this agreement, the Services, or any other transaction involving you and King, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis.</p>","21.02":"<p>21.2 Initial Dispute Resolution: If you have any concerns or queries regarding our Services, our customer support team can be reached through our King Community portal (<a href=\"http://community.king.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://community.king.com</a>).

ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED. Under this agreement, binding arbitration shall be administered by JAMS, a nationally recognized arbitration authority, under its procedures then in effect for consumer related disputes, but excluding any rules that permit joinder or class actions in arbitration (for more detail on procedure, see paragraph 21.5 below). You and King understand and agree that (a) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this paragraph 21, (b) this agreement memorialises a transaction in interstate commerce, and (c) this paragraph 21 shall survive termination of this agreement.</p>","21.04":"<p>21.4 Arbitration Procedure: If you or King commences arbitration, the arbitration shall be governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect when the arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class or representative basis (the “JAMS Rules”), available at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267, and under the rules set forth in this agreement. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and must follow applicable law. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable. Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is excluded from arbitration under paragraph 21.6. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. In some instances, the costs of arbitration can exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. The arbitrator’s award is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.  You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone. Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence, or in Los Angeles, California, at your option. Instructions for initiating an arbitration are available at the JAMS website and toll-free number referenced above.</p>","21.05":"<p>21.5 Class Action Waiver: The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE PRIVACY POLICY ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>","21.06":"<p>21.6 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Services under these terms.

However, as a resident in the European Economic Area, you agree that when you purchase Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money from us, you request immediate performance and that you understand this means you will lose your statutory right to withdraw from your purchase and the associated terms once you access and use the Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money. If you are resident in the United Kingdom, when you purchase Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money and we immediately supply the Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money to you, you will be asked to acknowledge that this means you will lose your statutory right to withdraw from your purchase and the associated terms.</p><br/><h4>Connecting your game play</h4><br/><p>4.5 If you do not connect your Game on a device to a King account, we will not be able to restore any Virtual Content, or other data associated with your Game to a different device if you lose, damage or change that device. Accordingly, on a device which is not connected to your King Account:</p><br/><ul><br/><li>any risk of loss of Virtual Content which you purchase from us is transferred to you upon completion of the purchase as described in paragraph 4.1 above;</li><br/><li>any risk of loss of Virtual Content that you receive from us without making a purchase is transferred to you at the time the Virtual Content is successfully credited to your account on our servers; and</li><br/><li>any risk of loss of other data associated with your Game play (including, without limitation, your progress through the Game, or the level or score you have reached in our Games) is transferred to you immediately at the time such Game play data is generated.</li><br/></ul><br/><p>4.6 The data associated with Virtual Content (whether purchased by you using real money or otherwise credited or awarded to you) is synced between different devices only if you have connected your Game to a King Account. Accordingly, any risk of loss of this data is transferred to you (i) in the case of Virtual Content which you purchase from us, upon completion of the purchase as described in paragraph 4.1 above; and/or (ii) in other cases at the time the Virtual Content is credited or awarded to you.</p><br/><p>4.7 If you live in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, we will provide you with a VAT invoice where we are required to do so by law or where expressly requested by you. You agree that these invoices may be electronic in format.</p><br/><p>4.8 We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any Virtual Content without any liability to you at any time, but if you have an active Subscription such changes will only take effect following the end of the then-current Subscription period, at which date your Subscription will automatically terminate.</p><br/><p>4.9 We may revise the pricing for Virtual Goods and Virtual Money at any time. We may also revise the pricing for Subscriptions offered through the Services with reasonable notice to you and in accordance with applicable law, but if you have an active Subscription such changes will only take effect following the end of the then-current Subscription period. When we give you notice, we will remind you that your continued use after the end of your then-current Subscription period means that you accept the new Subscription prices. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, if you don't cancel before the price changes come into force, you will be deemed to have accepted those modifications. If you are resident in Germany, nothing in this paragraph 4.9 is intended to affect your statutory rights, and we will enact any price revisions in accordance with applicable law.</p><br/><p>4.10 We may limit the total amount of Virtual Content that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total amount of Virtual Content that may be held in your account in the aggregate. You are only allowed to obtain Virtual Content from us or our authorised partners through the Services, and not in any other way.</p><br/><p>4.11 Depending on your platform, any Virtual Content purchased may be subject to your platform provider's terms of service and user agreement. Usage rights for each purchase may differ from item to item. If you are unsure about usage rights you should check with your platform or our customer support team before making a purchase. Unless otherwise shown, content available in any in-game store has the same age rating as the Game.</p><br/><p>4.12 Without limiting paragraphs 3.7, 3.8, 4.5, or 7.1, if we suspend or terminate your account in accordance with these Terms you may lose any Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money that you may have and we will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you. If you have an active Subscription at the date of termination it will not auto-renew at the end of the then-current Subscription period.</p><br/><p>4.13 The charge for any Virtual Content that you can purchase via our Services will be as stated in our Services at the time you place the order, except in the case of obvious error. The charge is inclusive of all sales taxes and other charges. Depending on which bank you use, additional charges may be issued by your bank; we have no control over this and accept no liability in relation to the same. If you are unsure whether you will be subject to such additional charges then you should check with your bank before making a purchase. We accept payment via our payment processing partners by credit card, debit card, carrier billing and any other payment method we expressly authorise during the payment process. Our payment processing partners may have their own terms and conditions and you should ensure you agree with these prior to making any payment. If your transaction with our payment processing partners is not successful then your purchase will not be fulfilled. Upon the completion of a successful payment transaction then your purchase will be fulfilled to you as soon as possible - we will endeavour to fulfil your order immediately at the point of purchase.</p><br/><h4>Subscriptions</h4><br/><p>4.14 Payment for a Subscription will be charged to your account at the point of purchase and, for renewals, will be taken within the 24 hours prior to the expiry of the then-current Subscription period. Your Subscription will automatically renew on the basis communicated to you in writing unless you turn off auto-renew via your platform settings at least 24 hours before the end of the then-current Subscription period. Your Subscription is linked to your platform account and cannot be transferred between platform accounts. You agree that sales of Subscriptions are final and that cancellation is not permitted mid-way during an active Subscription period (subject to paragraph 4.15 below if you are resident in the European Economic Area).</p><br/><p>4.15 For residents of the European Economic Area, if you have purchased a new Subscription, you have the right to withdraw from the purchase and the applicable purchase terms within fourteen (14) calendar days for any reason, subject to the below. This right of withdrawal does not apply to renewals of your existing Subscription. Your right of withdrawal starts from the day after your purchase of the Subscription. Instructions on how to exercise this right are set out at the end of these Terms in Appendix 1 (Section A: 'Information concerning the exercise of the right of withdrawal'). For residents of the United Kingdom and countries outside of the European Economic Area, when you purchase a Subscription from us and receive immediate access to it, you will be asked to acknowledge that this means you will lose your statutory right to withdraw from the purchase.</p>","05":"<h3>5 User conduct and content</h3>","05.01":"<p>5.1 You must comply with the laws that apply to you in the location that you access our Services from.

See JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW below for details. (9 U.S.C. §1, et seq.). The BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS WAIVER is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §1, et seq.) (\"<strong>FAA</strong>\") and federal arbitration law.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>21.2 The BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions in this paragraph 21 apply to all Disputes between you and King and/or King's Affiliates relating to the Games and Services. Paragraph 21 also applies to any Dispute (as defined below) between you and any King Affiliates, each of which is an intended third-party beneficiary of paragraph 21. \"<strong>Affiliate</strong>\" means any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with King, where 'control' means the direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of such entity's capital or equivalent voting rights.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>21.3 To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you and we agree to submit all Disputes between us to individual, binding arbitration pursuant to the provisions in this paragraph 21. A \"<strong>Dispute</strong>\" means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between you and King and/or King's Affiliates that in any way relates to or arises from any aspect of our relationship, including, without limitation, your use or attempted use of the Services, all marketing related to the Services, all Services, Virtual Content, contests, tournaments, and all matters relating to or arising from these Terms (including King's Privacy Policy and all other terms incorporated into these Terms) or any other agreement between you and King, including any disputes over the validity or enforceability of these Terms to arbitrate. A Dispute shall be subject to these BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions regardless of whether it is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), warranty or any other legal or equitable theory. This includes Disputes, claims, or requests for relief arising at any time, including those that accrued before you entered into these Terms. You understand that there is no judge or jury in arbitration and that court review of an arbitration award is limited.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>21.4 Initial Dispute Resolution: If you have any concerns or queries regarding our Services, our customer support team can be reached through our King Community portal (<a href=\"http://community.king.com/\">http://community.king.com</a>). Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any Dispute between you and King and/or King's Affiliates, you agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before either party initiates any arbitration or court proceeding (the \"<strong>Initial Dispute Resolution Period</strong>\"). That period begins upon receipt of written notice from the party raising the Dispute. If King has a Dispute with you, it will send notice of that Dispute to your billing address and email address you have provided to us. If you have a Dispute with King and/or King's Affiliates, you must notify us in writing at the following email address: <a href=\"mailto:queries@support.king.com\">queries@support.king.com</a>, using the subject line \"Initial Dispute Resolution Notice.\" Your notice of Dispute must be individual to you and must include your name, the screen name and email address associated with your player account (if any), and your residential address. The notice of Dispute also must describe the Dispute, explain the facts of the Dispute as you understand them, and tell King what you want us to do to resolve the problem. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any Dispute directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, and you agree that a notice of Dispute containing all of the information required above, followed by at least 30 days of good faith negotiation, are preconditions to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. A notice of Dispute will not be valid, will not start the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, and will not allow you or King later to initiate a lawsuit or arbitration, unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph. If either of us commences an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant notice of Dispute, you and King agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend the arbitration until the party that initiated it complies with the Initial Dispute Resolution Period. You and King authorise the arbitration provider or the arbitrator to decide summarily whether the party that commenced an arbitration complied with the Initial Dispute Resolution Period requirement, relying solely on these Terms and the notice of Dispute (if any) that you or King provided before commencing arbitration.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>21.5 Binding Arbitration and Arbitration Procedure: If a Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations during the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve the Dispute, unless an exception applies as stated below. Except in the event of a Mass Arbitration (as defined below), the arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \"<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>\") effective as of the date of the Notice of Dispute, which are available at the JAMS website, <a href=\"http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration\">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration</a>, as modified by these Terms. If, for any reason, JAMS is unable to provide the arbitration, then except as otherwise stated below, you may file your Dispute with any national arbitration company that handles consumer arbitrations following procedures that are substantially similar to the JAMS Rules. Arbitration hearings may be conducted by videoconference or telephone unless the arbitrator believes an in-person hearing is necessary. In such instances, the location of an arbitration hearing will be decided pursuant to the JAMS Rules. For players using Games from within the United States but who are not residents of the United States, arbitration will be initiated in Los Angeles County, California, and you and Activision agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgement on the award entered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law. If the Dispute does not exceed $25,000, the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of written submissions. The parties may bring any dispositive motion or motions during the course of the proceedings. Discovery in the arbitration will be limited to that necessary to resolve the dispute. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and us, and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator and not any federal, state or local court or agency, has exclusive authority to determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration as well as to decide all issues arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, validity, arbitrability, enforceability and/or formation of this agreement to arbitrate, including, but not limited to, where a party raises as a defence to arbitration that the claims in question are exempted from the arbitration requirement or that any portion of this agreement is void, voidable, or not enforceable. If a lawsuit filed in court includes claims or requests for relief that are arbitrable and claims or requests for relief that are not, you and we agree that any non-arbitrable claims or requests for relief will be stayed pending the completion of the arbitration of the arbitrable claims or requests for relief.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>21.6 Class Action Waiver: TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. To the fullest extent applicable law does not permit waiver of private attorney general claims, but permits them to be arbitrated, then such claims shall be resolved in arbitration. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NO ACTION WILL BE BROUGHT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS AND YOU UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING SUIT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>21.7 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the licence granted to you for the Services under these Terms. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for any individual Disputes within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. If an arbitration is filed, before the arbitrator is formally appointed either party can send written notice to the opposing party and the applicable arbitration provider that it wants the case decided by a small claims court, after which the arbitration provider must close the case.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>21.8 Exception – Mass Arbitration Before FedArb: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to have arbitrations administered by JAMS, if 20 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that this will constitute a \"Mass Arbitration.\" If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it will not be governed by JAMS Rules or administered by JAMS. Instead, a Mass Arbitration will be administered by FedArb, a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the FedArb Rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the \"FedArb Rules\"), and under the rules set forth in these Terms. The FedArb Rules are available at <a href=\"https://www.fedarb.com/\">https://www.fedarb.com/</a> or by calling 1-650-328-9500. You and we agree that the Mass Arbitration will be resolved using FedArb's Framework for Mass Arbitration Proceedings ADR-MDL, available at <a href=\"https://www.fedarb.com/\">https://www.fedarb.com/</a>. Before any Mass Arbitration is filed with FedArb, you and we agree to contact FedArb jointly to advise that the parties intend to use FedArb's Framework for Mass Arbitration Proceedings ADR-MDL. The individual demands comprising the Mass Arbitration will be submitted on FedArb's claim form(s) and as directed by FedArb. You and Activision agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before FedArb rather than JAMS, you or Activision may seek an order from JAMS compelling compliance and directing administration of the Mass Arbitration before FedArb. Pending resolution of any such requests, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) will be stayed.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p>21.9 30 Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration agreement and class action waiver provisions in in this paragraph 21 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: King.com Ltd Aragon Business Centre Level 4, Dragonara Road, St Julian's STJ3140, Malta, Attn: King Legal.
