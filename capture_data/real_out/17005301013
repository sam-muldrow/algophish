				<div><h1>Long-Term Blog Development Strategy - A Guide From Semalt&nbsp;</h1></div><div><img src="/webcontents/successful-blogging-strategy-1024x619-16383750370.jpg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>Blogging is usually not something that is only done in the short term. In many cases, it turns into a passion, something carried out for at least a few years. Therefore, a long-term blog development strategy is important, i.e. planning certain steps in advance.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, it is extremely important!</div><div><br></div><div>Very often we come across news in which bloggers inform us that they want to revolutionize their website. In many cases, this is due to ignorance from a few years back or bad advice, so that after a while very radical measures are sometimes necessary.</div><div><br></div><div>How to avoid the initial mistakes that may later result in sleepless nights and unnecessary expenses?</div><div><br></div><div>In this article, the main topic of which is a long-term blog development strategy, you will find 8 tips related to this issue. You will learn absolutely essential things that need to be addressed as soon as possible with&nbsp;<a href="https://semalt.com/dedicated-seo-dashboard">tools that obviously need</a>&nbsp;to be used.</div><div><br></div><div>I invite you to read it!</div><div><h2>1. Try to minimize obligations and dependencies</h2></div><div>We have already encountered a situation where the owner of the company was not the owner of the server and the domain at the same time. They were bought by someone else and registered on that person.</div><div><br></div><div>When the owner of the company found out that this was the case after a few years (he had not been interested in these matters before - he was just dealing with his business, leaving the website issues to someone else), he wanted to put it all in order. So he or she requested to rewrite everything on him.</div><div><br></div><div>The proceedings began, namely that the "steward" (let's call him that) demanded remuneration in addition to a lot of other things. The disruptions took a long time and a lot of nerves before they finally came to an end.</div><div><br></div><div>This could be avoided by ensuring that basic elements such as domain and hosting were formally registered under the appropriate entity.</div><div><br></div><div>Now <b>story number two</b>, also taken from real life:</div><div><br></div><div>A blogger decided to use the services of a website positioning company.</div><div><br></div><div>He got involved with a company that had previously sent him an offer by e-mail. He signed the contract for two years.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, two years.</div><div><br></div><div>After a few months, he began to notice that there was no correlation between the excellent results presented by the SEO company and their translation into traffic and business goals. He became interested in the subject and learned from another source that the focus was on positioning completely irrelevant phrases. He also scoured the internet for reviews of the service provider and finally was far from satisfied.</div><div><br></div><div>A number of questions arise.</div><div><br></div><div>Why had the recognition not been made earlier? Why did he give full permission to compile a list of sentences without suggesting a single sentence of his own? Why did he agree to be bound by a 24-month contract?</div><div><br></div><div>Unfortunately, they remain unanswered.</div><div><br></div><div>I present both stories with one goal in mind - to make you aware that many rash decisions can have very negative consequences in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>Of course, I don't want to cause panic and say a priori that Internet activity is fraught with pitfalls at every turn. What I mean is that any decision deserves to be thought through for a while. Weigh the pros and cons, and seek advice from several independent sources.</div><div><br></div><div>Let's try to make a small list of the critical elements that should be taken into account when planning a long-term blog development strategy:</div><div><h3>Don't go for the first-class hosting and domain provider</h3></div><div>Ask for advice from real users, check all price lists (not only for the first year but also for subsequent ones) and find out about the procedure for a possible change of provider of the above-mentioned services.</div><div><br></div><div>Focus on as many services as possible - do not register them on other entities.</div><div><br></div><div>Obtain login credentials for all services at the administrative level.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ask, ask and ask again. There are no stupid questions, only the answers can be stupid. Do it not only by phone or face to face, where many things are taken care of "on the spot". Also, do it by email to keep the text (traceability) in front of your eyes at any time.</div><div><h3>Always weigh the pros and cons, consult with various sources</h3></div><div>Try to find recommendations and opinions, ask others for their views. However, skillfully distinguish between real and questionable opinions.</div><div><br></div><div>To sum up, I want to alert you to the fact that initially - seemingly - trivial matters can turn into very serious over time.</div><div><br></div><div>This is why a long-term blog development strategy is so necessary.</div><div><h2>2. Become more productive</h2></div><div><img src="/webcontents/20141120005318-6-secrets-productive-16383763300.jpeg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>If we make an occupation a regular activity, then we properly optimize the time spent - don't we? Blogging takes time. There is no discussion about that. It's not just about writing texts. First of all, the website itself has to be taken care of to get it in order. Then, its condition must be checked periodically.</div><div><br></div><div>Everything that is done after the publication of texts and just between writing articles is important. There is a whole host of activities worth taking.</div><div><br></div><div>Advertising, gaining greater reach, making friends, acquiring knowledge - all this is also part of broadly understood blogging.</div><div><br></div><div>I always emphasize that eliminating time wasters is essential. Yes, looking at Facebook and other, mainly smartphone applications (the biggest obstacles for the entire mass of bloggers) out of the corner of your eye should be avoided.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What's more, it's also a good idea to plan all tasks in advance, and also count the time needed to perform individual activities.</div><div><h2>3. Take care of acquaintances and establish relationships</h2></div><div><img src="/webcontents/recruitment-image-small-16371836400.jpg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>A long-term blog development strategy also requires cooperation with others in various fields.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cooperation with a person or company operating in a complementary sector, creating a joint e-book with someone, promoting each other's content, guest contributions: as you can see, there are many ways to exchange opinions, relationships and contacts. The above suggestions are only a fraction of the options available and what you see here and there on the internet.</div><div><br></div><div>You know very well how useful friendships in life can be. You never know when a person's contacts will be salutary in a given situation.</div><div><br></div><div>In summary, not closing yourself off from others and being proactive (that is, taking action, not just waiting for opportunities) are really desirable things.</div><div><h2>4. Get the condition of your blog in order</h2></div><div>Articles are one thing, while the base - that is, the blog itself - is another. After all, a blog is a website, so it must be well-kept technically.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="/webcontents/Obzor-kriptovalyutnyh-plaginov-dlya-WordPress-16383776010.jpg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>The basis is the right platform. You won't be surprised if I make it clear that the best solution is a WordPress blog. Another thing is choosing a company that will provide hosting, domain and SSL certificates for you. As I mentioned before, do not choose the first provider encountered. Read, ask, look for opinions on Facebook groups.</div><div><br></div><div>Remember that your choice in the context of the right domain is extremely important. Yes, you can change the address after some time, but it has several consequences that are not the most pleasant.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The WordPress theme should also be chosen wisely. I assume that you will modify it many times over the next months or years - this is normal. If so, choose a proven, regularly-updated theme.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, don't overload the page with plugins. We know this is an essential feature of WordPress, but the general rule is that the more plugins, the worse it is. Excess form over content leads to problems with site speed and stability, among other things.</div><div><h2>5. Create your own brand</h2></div><div><img src="/webcontents/10-Ways-to-Build-Your-Personal-Brand-1-16383777330.jpg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>The long-term blog development strategy is closely related to the so-called brand and its image. Keep the following in mind:</div><div><ul><li>A unique, catchy name that is easy to remember.</li><li>A domain, selected for this name, preferably in the form of 1:1.</li><li>A logo - universal, eye-catching, and preferably with a signet ring, which can be separated from the logo if necessary (it is useful in many places).</li><li>A brand book that explains how to use the logo and selects the appropriate brand colors.</li></ul></div><div>The above-mentioned example elements contribute to consistency.</div><div><br></div><div>It's just that the blog's image should be uniform. Everyone from a distance needs to know that it is this particular page or person.</div><div><h2>6. Revisit old content regularly</h2></div><div>Going back to old content is something that a long-term blog development strategy should be based on.</div><div><br></div><div>Two activities must be distinguished here.</div><div><br></div><div>The first is the mention of old texts in new entries. When I refer to a topic that was once discussed in great detail, I use its link. In this way, I refer readers interested in a given topic to a place where they can read a lot more about it.</div><div><br></div><div>The second issue is refreshing old entries.</div><div><br></div><div>When you do not have an idea for a new topic at the moment, "tweaking" an archival text and supplementing it with new information (and - if necessary - removing outdated ones) is a great solution. At the same time, you update the old content in terms of readers and inform Google robots about the changes.</div><div><h2>7. Watch the competition</h2></div><div>Observing the actions of your competitors can be of great benefit. First of all, it gives information in the context of what methods or techniques are used by competitors to develop. There is never enough knowledge, and what exactly to do with it depends only on you. It's also useful to look at competitors more technically.</div><div><br></div><div>Competition monitoring allows you to find out from which places they obtain links, what keywords they are interested in, and in general what steps they take to gain visibility in Google's organic results.</div><div><h2>8. Educate yourself constantly</h2></div><div>At the very end, it is an obvious point, but it could not be missed in this statement. The long-term strategy of blog development is closely related to the development and acquisition of new knowledge. It is not possible to keep a blog for years and "start" on the same basis.</div><div><br></div><div>Virtually, every industry is developing, various technical innovations emerge, trends change. So be up to date! Readers need to see that you keep your finger on the pulse and provide them with information relevant to the present day.</div><div><h2>Which tool to use for a successful long-term blog development strategy?</h2></div><div>For a successful blog development strategy, in the long run, a well-designed SEO tool like the&nbsp;<a href="https://semalt.com/dedicated-seo-dashboard">SEO Dedicated Dashboard</a>&nbsp;should become your best partner. Indeed, with this latest generation SEO tool at your fingertips, you can have the right solutions to develop your blog and start receiving thousands of free visits.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src="/webcontents/%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA_2_04_10_2021-16333838320.jpeg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>The <b>Dedicated SEO Dashboard</b> is a highly visual and intuitive tool developed by the experts at Semalt to help SEO agencies and bloggers save time and achieve real and lasting results.</div><div><br></div><div>With a reasonably priced subscription, you will be able to rank your website at the top of the search engines and take advantage of its many benefits.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I invite you to take a closer look at some of the benefits of the <b>Dedicated SEO Dashboard</b>.</div><div><h3>1.	Conduct a competitive analysis easily</h3></div><div>As we have already mentioned in the article, competitive analysis is a very important step that allows you to better understand the market through those who are better positioned than you in your field.</div><div><br></div><div>To perform such an analysis, you can rely on the Google SERP analysis feature of the Dedicated SEO Dashboard. This feature allows you to know who the main competitors are in the right niche, all their traffic-generating keywords as well as their promotion strategy.</div><div><h3>2.	Perform an SEO audit for your blog easily</h3></div><div>When creating a blog, you are not supposed to be an SEO expert, but if you are in internet marketing, you will surely need to familiarise yourself with it. Understanding the structure and status of your blog will certainly help you get much better results on search engines (Google, Bing, etc.).</div><div><br></div><div>To achieve a thorough audit for your blog and know its exact status, you can use the SEO technical audit feature of the SEO Dashboard.</div><div><br></div><div>One of the competitive advantages of our SEO Personal Dashboard is that you can perform a complete site analysis. In addition, the tool gives you important suggestions to improve the state of your website in order to get good visibility.</div><div><h3>3.	Obtain SEO reports regularly</h3></div><div>The SEO Dashboard is an excellent SEO reporting tool for SEO agencies and freelance SEO professionals. You can easily track changes by comparing your site to the previous version and so, understand the impact of corrections on the quality of your website. Indeed, the Report Center is another unique feature of our innovation-driven SEO Dashboard.</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, the SEO Dashboard has several features that I invite you to discover on&nbsp;<a href="https://demo.semalt.com/">demo.semalt.com</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Long-term blog development strategy - is it really needed?</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Before answering the above question, let us return for a moment to the situation discussed in the first point.</div><div><br></div><div>It's not a pleasant situation when a blogger asks for help on such basic issues where - it seems - there should be no problem. Yet they do appear, mainly because, for example, the former website contractor doesn't want to give up ownership of the domain, demands horrendously high margins to extend his/her services, or has made such a "mess" of the code that anyone from the outside doesn't even want to see those pages.</div><div><br></div><div>Unfortunately, such situations do occur, and until our awareness - that of the users - increases, nothing will change. The weakest will continue to be exploited.</div><div><br></div><div>Bloggers, remember! Search the Internet for real opinions, read all agreements and conditions of cooperation carefully, read the price lists for the entire duration of the service and choose only proven and reliable colleagues.</div><div><br></div><div>Many unpleasant situations can be avoided in advance by spending a really little effort on reconnaissance.</div><div><br></div><div>In my opinion, the long-term strategy of blog development is mainly related to minimizing the dependence of your blog on other entities in absolutely different fields. The more you hold in your own hand, the better.</div><div><br></div>				<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-mass-mail-%2B-html-ins/obngoldljmnnpggbekneikaohbeflbee">send email</a>
