        <h2>Introduction; Scope of this Policy.</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, "Schooljobs", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).</p>
        <p>By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into our <a href="/home/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a>. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in the <a href="/home/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a>. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to the <a href="/home/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a> and this Policy, including limitations on liability.</p>
        <p>This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below); (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “Platform Data”). We use Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services.</p>
        <p>We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="nobreak">
        <h2>Where We Are a Service Provider</h2>
        <p>Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data, and we process personal data as a data processor or service provider. Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies.</p>
        <p>For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.</p>
        <p>Where we serve as a data processor, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Personal Data We Collect About You and Why.</h2>
    <p>In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year.

We also automatically collect data during your usage and collect other personal data about you from other sources. Your personal data will only be collected and used for purposes stated herein, where you provide additional consent, or as required by law or regulation - including national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

    <p class="sub-header"><strong>Information Collected When Using the PowerLine Application</strong></p>
    <p>Our purpose in providing the PowerLine Application (“App”) is very simple:  to help you maximize your mental wellbeing. Our commitment to protecting your privacy while using the App comes from a deep awareness of the sensitivity of information regarding one’s mental wellbeing. If your employer has sponsored your access to our App, we will only collect from you the minimum personal information necessary to set up your initial access to the App (name, email address).  Thereafter, your access to and use of the App will be anonymous and will not be tracked.  In this way, we can protect your privacy while helping you manage your health.</p>
    <p>Anonymous Data refers to data that by itself does not permit the identification of a specific individual. We collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with the App. We may collect the following types of Anonymous Data when you use the App:</p>
    <ul class="list-items-nobreak">
        <li>Measurement data produced by the Apps. We may collect the Apps version, device hardware model, device operating system (OS) version, language and region settings, or timestamp.</li>
        <li>Apps crash reports. When the App crashes, we may collect information relating to the crash including device state, device hardware model, device OS version, and software processes that triggered the crash.</li>
        <li>Apps usage and interactions. We may collect statistics about the behavior of users of the App to understand how they interact with the App and for error reporting.</li>

    <p>We disclose personal data to our Customers (your current or potential employer) that utilize our services. For instance, when a job applicant responds to a job posting, we will share your personal data with the employer in order to facilitate the job search and hiring process. If your current or former employer uses one of our Services, personal data you input into those Services is accessible by that employer’s end users - subject to the security and access controls set up by the employer.

You may cancel your Access membership at any time.</p>
    <p class="sub-header"><strong>To Service Providers.</strong></p>

For instance, we use service providers to facilitate our support services, data security, email, web hosting, research and analytics, data enrichment services, deliver and help us track our marketing and advertising content, process credit card payments, deliver payroll processing and disbursements, coordinate our customer conferences, and manage our sales and customer relations.</p>
    <p>We share personal data with analytics and advertising companies that may act as our processor and a controller in other instances.

    <p class="sub-header"><strong>To other parties when you give your consent.</strong></p>
    <p>We may also share personal data where you provide your consent or post your personal data publicly. Where required by law, additional consent is obtained before personal data is transferred to us or forwarded to other parties. For example, we share personal data with background check providers if a job applicant consents and we are instructed to do so by our Customers.</p>
    <p>During your use of the Services, you may have the opportunity to visit or link to other websites, including websites by third parties unaffiliated with us. We have no relationship or control over unaffiliated websites. These websites might collect personal data about you, and you should review the privacy policies of such other websites to see how they treat your personal data.</p>
    <p class="sub-header"><strong>To other third parties where required by law.</strong></p>

    <p>We may transfer or disclose personal data to another entity who acquires or may acquire any or all of our business units, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets, or bankruptcy.

    <p>Other data gathering mechanisms, such as web beacons, HTML Storage Objects, and web tags, are used by us and our service providers to gather more specific data on your use. A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things. HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Online Services.</p>

    <p class="sub-header"><strong>Lawful Basis for Processing.</strong></p>
    <p>For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including:</p>
    <p><strong>Consent.</strong> In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Legitimate Interest.</strong> We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests.</p>
    <p><strong>Performance of a Contract</strong> We process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.</p>
    <p><strong>Other Legal Bases.</strong> In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.</p>
    <p class="sub-header"><strong>Automated Decision Making and Profiling.</strong></p>
    <p>We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.</p>
    <p class="sub-header"><strong>International Transfers.</strong></p>
    <p>For personal data transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, we will provide appropriate safeguards, such as through use of standard contractual clauses.</p>
    <p>We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your sensitive data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data, please submit a written request to <a href="mailto:privacy@governmentjobs.com">privacy@governmentjobs.com</a>.</p>
    <p>In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
    <h2>Data Security and Integrity.</h2>
    <p>We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us.</p>
    <p>Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and we complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password.</p>
    <p>In the event we believe the security of your personal data in our possession or control may be compromised, we may seek to notify you by e-mail and you consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.</p>
    <h2>Retention and Removal.</h2>
    <p>For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or anonymize, or de-identify your personal data (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain Platform Data as permitted by law.</p>
    <p>Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed, anonymized, or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.</p>
    <h2>Information on Children.</h2>
    <p>These Services are not directed at children under the age of thirteen (13) and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of thirteen (13).

If you believe that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 without parental consent, you may report this to us using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.</p>
    <p>If you are a California resident under 18 years old, you have the right to remove personal data you have posted to our Services.

    <h2>Right to Revise.</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to revise our Policy to reflect changes in our online information practices or to comply with the law by publishing a new version on our website. In circumstances where we materially change the way in which we collect or use personal data, we materially change the terms of this Policy, or where personal data is no longer used consistently with a previously named purpose, we will provide notice and publish the new version on our website.

            <p>Copyright Infringement.   Our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”).

            <p>If you believe in good faith that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our copyright agent the written information specified below. Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying us that your copyrighted material has been infringed. We do not and will not make any legal decisions about the validity of your claim of infringement or the possible defenses to a claim. When a clear and valid notice is received pursuant to the guidelines set forth below, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it. We may contact the notice provider to request additional information. Under the DMCA, we are required to take reasonable steps to notify the user who posted the allegedly infringing content (“Alleged Infringer”). The Alleged Infringer is allowed under the law to send us a counter-notification. Notices and counter-notices are legal notices distinct from regular activities or communications through the Service. We may publish or share them with third parties in our sole discretion (in addition to producing them pursuant to a subpoena or other legal discovery request). Anyone making a false or fraudulent notice or counter-notice may be liable for damages under the DMCA, including costs and attorneys’ fees. Any person who is unsure of whether certain material infringes a copyright held by such person or a third party should contact an attorney.</p>
            <p>To file a DMCA notice, the copyright owner must send in a written letter by regular mail only. We reserve the right to ignore a notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA, and we may, but are not obligated to, respond to a non-compliant notice.</p>

                <li>Identify the content that a copyright owner claims is infringing upon copyrighted work. The copyright owner must provide information reasonably sufficient to enable us to locate the item on the Service.

                <li>Provide information sufficient to permit us to contact the copyright owner directly: name, street address, telephone number, and email (if available);</li>
                <li>If available, provide information sufficient to permit us to notify the Alleged Infringer (email address preferred);</li>
                <li>Include the following statement: “I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law”;</li>
                <li>nclude the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed”;</li>
