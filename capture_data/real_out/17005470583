                          <h3>Data protection declaration of Planet49 GmbH</h3>
<p>Data protection is especially important to us &ndash; Planet49 GmbH (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;
    <strong>Planet49/us/we&rdquo;</strong>) of Am Unisys-Park 1, 65843 Sulzbach/Ts. Germany and represented by managing director,
    J&uuml;rgen B&ouml;ttcher. As the authority responsible for the scope, type and purpose of any form of personal data
    collection, storage, communication and/or use, in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we
    would like to ensure that you will be provided with all necessary information. You can reach us at any time, either by
    post to the above address, or by email to:
    <a href="mailto:info@planet49.com">info@planet49.com</a>.</p>
<p>Our data protection officers are available to you at the following address:
    <a href="mailto:privacy@planet49.com">privacy@planet49.com</a>.</p>
<p>With this declaration, we wish to provide you with information about the data protection relevant aspects of the services
    we offer and in particular:</p>
<ul>
    <li>on the collection and storage of your personal data,</li>
    <li>on the communication and use of your personal data and</li>
    <li>on your rights.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>The type of personal data we collect and store</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever you visit our website and/or contact us and/or fill out the data fields allowing you to use our website, personal
    data may be collected by us, as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We collect and process only personal data, which is made available to us with your knowledge when establishing contact
        and filling out the contact form. Typically, the personal data we collect is the following: name, address, company,
        country of residence, email address and any other data you may provide. No other personal data is collected by Planet49.</li>
    <li>Personal data, which may be collected during your visit to our site, and relating in particular to data volumes, data
        on location and time, IP addresses and other communications-related information, which is made available by the computer
        you are using.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above data, information relating to local time, time zones and usage data may also be collected and stored.</p>
<p>Visits to our website may also result in the collection and use of statistical information. Statistical information includes
    data relating to the use of a special Internet browser or versions thereof.</p>
<ol start="2">
    <li>
        <strong>How and why we process and transmit your personal data and how it is used</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>The personal data made available to us when you complete our contact form is only used to conduct the particular services
    requested by you and to perform the technical administration linked thereto; in this context, we wish to point out, that
    the personal information provided by you in the advertising email dispatch and/or when completing the contact form is
    used to record and store you as a contact in our contact programme (Art. 6 (1)(b) and (f) GDPR). No further direct collection
    of your personal data is carried out by us.</p>
<p>Personal data made available by you may also be transmitted by one of our partners on whose website you have previously registered
    and on which you gave your express consent to the receipt of advertising emails (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).</p>
<p>Within the scope of advertising email dispatch, we may then choose from time to time to send you marketing material by electronic
    post to the email address given by you. Such material may contain the products and services of third parties (Art. 6
    (1)(f) GDPR).</p>
<p>Processing of your personal data may also take place, as a result of the possible assertion of your rights (Art. 6 (1)(c)
    and (f) GDPR), as set out below in Clause 5 of this data protection declaration.</p>
<p>Furthermore, your personal data may be disclosed in such cases, in which there is a legal obligation for us to do so (Art.
    6 (1)(c) GDPR), or where it is necessary for the enforcement of rights, claims or legal defence, where and in so far
    as these are based on the legitimate interests of the organiser or other third parties (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR). The same
    applies in the case of the purchase or sale of goodwill and/or financial assets, in the case of the (even partial) takeover
    of a business by a third party, on the commencement of insolvency proceedings or where commencement is rejected due to
    lack of assets (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR).</p>
<p>Email addresses may not be transmitted to third parties for marketing purposes. You are, of course, entitled to object to
    the dispatch of advertising emails at any time. You can read about your right of revocation in Clause 5 of this data
    protection declaration.</p>
<ol start="3">
    <li>
        <strong>Where and for how long we store your personal data and to where your data may be exported</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>a) Your personal data is stored by us within the European Economic Area. No data transfer or storage takes place in any
    third country.</p>
<p>b) Provided no blocking or deletion takes place, in accordance with the rights set out in Clause 5 and exercised by you,
    your data is permanently stored for the purposes already outlined above.</p>
<p>Following any withdrawal of consent to the processing of your data and/or declaration of objection thereto, your data will
    be moved to our so-called &ldquo;blocking list&rdquo;. This means that your personal data is no longer used for marketing
    purposes. We then store your data only for legal purposes (e.g. burden of proof obligations, the assertion or defence
    of claims, etc.), deleting it on expiry of a four-year period, provided there are no compelling reasons to do otherwise
    or where, for other reasons - possibly in the way of renewed consent - an appropriate level of data processing is permitted.</p>
<p>Moreover, we proceed in the same way, if we have not used your personal data for a period of 24 months, that is, neither
    for our own marketing purposes nor those of our customers.</p>
<ol start="4">
    <li>
        <strong>Protection of your personal data</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>We take the relevant precautions - administrative, organisational, technical and physical - to protect your personal data
    against loss, theft, misuse, unauthorised access, unauthorised transmission, unauthorised amendment and destruction.
    This means, that your data is protected by entry controls (securely located servers, access to which is only granted
    under defined security procedures), admission controls (128-bit encoded data transmission, individual password, menu
    and employee authorisation, current virus software), access controls (individual employee access authorisation via personal
    accounts, identification and authentication requirements), disclosure controls (constant supervision and guidance to
    authorised personnel, no local storage of data, recording of all data exports and transmission), input controls (account-related
    auditing, time-stamp and host logging), task auditing (constant supervision by managers and data protection officers,
    transparent contract structure relating to the provisions of &sect; 62 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz,
    BDSG) and Art. 28 GDPR in coordination with management and data protection officers) and availability checks (general
    security procedures of the host [UPS, halon gas systems, etc.], back-up streaming to other general security procedures
    [e.g. UPS, halon gas systems, etc.], back-up streaming to other locations [with all security measures, see access controls]
    nightly mirroring onto two hard discs, virus protection program).</p>
<p>Despite these precautions and due to the insecure nature of the Internet, we are unable to guarantee the security of your
    data transmission to our website. Any transmission of your data to our website is, therefore, undertaken at your own
    risk.</p>
<ol start="5">
    <li>
        <strong>What you are entitled to do</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>You have the right, at any time and in accordance with the provisions of Art. 15 GDPR, to obtain information about the data
    stored about you as an individual, including the sources and recipients of your data, as well as the purposes of its
    subsequent processing.0}</p>
<p>You are also entitled, at any time, to demand the rectification of any incorrect personal data we hold with respect to you
    (Art. 16 GDPR). Processing can be restricted by satisfying one of the prerequisites listed in Art. 18 (1) GDPR, such
    as, for example, contesting the accuracy of your personal data.</p>
<p>Moreover, you are entitled to withdraw any declaration(s) of consent previously made and relating to the processing of your
