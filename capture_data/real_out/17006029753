By using the internet banking facility, you can easily transfer funds through RTGS on your own. The transactions in RTGS are settled grossly in real-time. Funds will be credited to the beneficiary’s account within 30 minutes.</p><p>The minimum amount that can be transferred through RTGS is Rs. 2 lakhs and there is no maximum limit. To initiate fund transfer in RTGS, the remitter should have beneficiary’s name, bank name, IFSC code and account number. In order to make transactions through RTGS, both the banks where the remitter and the beneficiary have their account, should contain RTGS facility.</p><p>As the fund transfer in RTGS is controlled by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the transactions are unchangeable and hence, it is final. Depending on the transaction amount, the remitter will be applied some charges. RTGS is meant especially for large amount transactions. RTGS service will be available only on working days.</p><h2>What is NEFT?</h2><p>National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) is an online fund transfer system supported by Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

NEFT functions on Deferred Net Settlement (DNS) in which transactions are settled in batches.</p><p>Funds can also be transferred via NEFT in online by using internet banking service. There is no maximum and minimum limit for transactions made in NEFT.</p><p>Nevertheless, the maximum transaction is limited to Rs. 50,000 per transaction. Depending on the amount of transaction, charges are applied. NEFT is ideal for small and medium amount transfer between bank accounts. In order to transfer funds through NEFT, the remitter should have beneficiary’s details such as name, bank name, account number and IFSC code.</p><p>NEFT works on hourly batches. For fund transfer to take place, both the banks where the remitter and beneficiary have their account should have NEFT service. The transferred funds will be credited to the beneficiary’s account within two days.</p><h2>What is IMPS?</h2><p>Immediate Payment System (IMPS) is an electronic fund transfer system operated by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and supported by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in which the remitter can immediately transfer funds from one account to another account.</p><p>IMPS is a 24 hours service and it is available on all days including holidays. Though it is a mobile based system, many banks offer this service via ATM and net banking too. Charges will be applied for transactions and it will differ for each bank.</p><p>The minimum and maximum transaction limits will change according to banks. To transfer funds via IMPS, the remitter should know the beneficiary’s account number and bank’s IFSC code. As it is an immediate payment service, fund transfer once initiated cannot be stopped.</p><p>Funds can be transferred using beneficiary’s MMID (Mobile Money Identifier) and mobile number or else by using account number and IFSC code. By using the mobile application of the respective bank, you can instantly transfer funds anytime.</p><h2>Some Banks</h2><div class="bLists"><ul><li><a
