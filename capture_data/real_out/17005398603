In this example, the borrower will receive $18,663 and will make 36 monthly payments of $643. Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $40,000 and loan term lengths range from 24 months to 60 months. Some amounts, rates, and term lengths may be unavailable in certain states. </p><p>For Personal Loans, APR ranges from 9.57% to 35.99% and origination fee ranges from 3.00% to 8.00% of the loan amount. APRs and origination fees are determined at the time of application. Lowest APR is available to borrowers with excellent credit. Advertised rates and fees are valid as of July 11, 2023 and are subject to change without notice. </p><p>Checking a rate through us generates a soft credit inquiry on a person’s credit report, which is visible only to that person. A hard credit inquiry, which is visible to that person and others, and which may affect that person’s credit score, only appears on the person’s credit report if and when a loan is issued to the person. Credit eligibility is not guaranteed. APR and other credit terms depend upon credit score and other key financing characteristics, including but not limited to the amount financed, loan term length, and credit usage and history.  </p></div><div class="disclaimer_disclaimerGlobalFooter__JKVZT"><p>Unless otherwise specified, all credit and deposit products are provided by LendingClub Bank, N.A., Member FDIC, Equal Housing Lender (“LendingClub Bank”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of LendingClub Corporation, NMLS ID 167439.

In this example, the borrower will receive $18,663 and will make 36 monthly payments of $643. Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $40,000 and loan term lengths range from 24 months to 60 months.

Common reasons for seeking protection from creditors include medical debt, credit card bills, a lost job, divorce, or a personal crisis. Because bankruptcy may involve the court-ordered liquidation of your assets and remain on your credit report for several years, bankruptcy is often a measure of last resort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy do people file for bankruptcy? Every story is unique, but most of them share at least some contributing factors. Here’s a closer look at some of the most common reasons for personal bankruptcy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eTop 7 Reasons People File for Bankruptcy\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost bankruptcies happen for one reason: too much debt and too little income. In 2022, there were 374,240 non-business bankruptcy filings in the U.S., each with its own story – and, most likely, multiple contributing causes behind it. Someone took on a sizable mortgage, then lost their job. Another was injured in a car accident and ended up with medical expenses and a prolonged leave of absence from work without pay. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough there are a million possible reasons why people might file bankruptcy, the following contributing factors are commonly cited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e1. Loss of Income\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eJob loss, pay cuts, disability, and business failure can all leave people unable to keep up with their monthly debt payments. The financial fallout of unemployment isn’t limited to lost wages: Many who lose their jobs pay high insurance premiums through COBRA. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e2. Medical Expenses\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Kaiser Family Foundation Health Care Debt Survey found that 41% of adults had debt caused by medical or dental bills, and nearly one in five of those with medical debt thought they would never be able to pay it off. Nearly half who owed medical debt had used up all or most of their savings, while 40% took an extra job or worked more hours; 41% increased credit card debt; and 37% skipped or delayed paying other bills.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a study published in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6366487/\"\u003eAmerican Journal of Public Health\u003c/a\u003e, medical expenses and medical problems causing work loss contributed to 66.5% of bankruptcies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e3. Unaffordable Mortgage\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMortgages are often the largest debt people carry—and the most consequential. Defaulting on a mortgage could mean losing your home and your equity in a foreclosure. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFiling for bankruptcy can put a pause on foreclosure activities. Although bankruptcy may not stop a foreclosure altogether, it may provide you the option of eliminating mortgage debt if you give up your home or avoiding foreclosure by enacting a repayment plan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e4. Student Loans\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Federal Reserve, four in 10 people who attended college took out student loans to fund their education. Among people who had outstanding debt from their own education in 2022, the median student loan balance was between $20,000 and $24,999.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven that student loan payments have resumed and there’s still uncertainty about additional forgiveness, some people carrying student loan debt may have difficulty meeting other debt obligations or even basic living expenses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e5. Overwhelming Debt\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDebt can easily become unmanageable. While overspending is a possible culprit, debt also adds up when you’ve used student loans to pay for college, financed a car so you can commute to work, or used credit cards to cope with the rising cost of necessities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e6. Helping Friends or Relatives\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHelping loved ones in need is a kindness, but it can create financial problems if they’re unable (or unwilling) to repay you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e7. Divorce\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDivorce is a major financial disruptor. Splitting a single household into two may double your monthly expenses (without increasing your monthly income). Shouldering legal costs, dividing assets, and untangling joint debt can add to financial stress. Child and spousal support often feel like too little for the recipient and too much for the payer. And for many, divorce isn’t the beginning of financial trouble: Money difficulties can be both a symptom and a cause of marital problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eStrategies to Help Avoid\u003cb\u003e Bankruptcy\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBankruptcy is an extreme measure that can have far-reaching consequences for your credit score and financial wellbeing.

Although creditors aren’t obligated to work with you, many will offer temporary hardship assistance, workouts, and lump sum settlements depending on the type and contractual age of the account. Keep in mind, reducing your debt obligation by settling with a creditor for less than the full balance owed will have a negative impact on your credit score,\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDebt Settlement\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDebt settlement involves \u003ca href=\"https://www.lendingclub.com/resource-center/personal-loan/what-is-a-debt-management-plan\"\u003esettling your debts for less than you owe\u003c/a\u003e, often using the services of a debt settlement company.

You may be able to negotiate with your creditors or take advantage of credit counseling or use a debt management plan that can put your finances back on track. If you’ve determined you’re unable to repay your debts and decide to move foward with bankruptcy proceedings, it’s a good idea to contact a qualified attorney who can help guide you through the process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFrequently Asked Questions\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does bankruptcy work?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBankruptcy is a complex process. Generally, after demonstrating you can’t repay your debts and completing some credit counseling, if you choose to move forward you’ll need to decide whether to proceed with a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. While both types of bankruptcy relieve debt in different ways, they both can also help provide relief from unsecured debt (such as personal loans or credit cards), put a stop to foreclosure or repossession of your home or car, as well as end wage garnishments, utility shut-offs, and debt collector activity. In both cases, you can usually expect to pay your own attorney fees and court costs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo ensure you receive proper guidance, it’s probably best to discuss your financial situation with a bankruptcy attorney, as well as the rules, regulations and possible options and outcomes you may face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDoes bankruptcy erase all debts?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA bankruptcy can erase all your debts, but it doesn’t always. Nondischargeable debts include tax claims, child or spousal support, debts for willful or malicious injury, government fines, and some condominium or cooperative housing fees. Debts that are not listed in bankruptcy court filings may not be included in the discharge. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWill bankruptcy ruin your credit score?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA bankruptcy significantly affects both your credit score and credit report. Bankruptcies appear in the public records section of your credit report for up to 10 years from the date of discharge. Your creditors may also mark any accounts discharged in bankruptcy as “included in bankruptcy.” This information can stay in your credit file for seven years. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow many times can you file bankruptcy?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are limitations to how often you can receive a discharge of debts through bankruptcy.

These will not impact or change your credit scores.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA credit check is considered a hard inquiry if it is used in a decision about issuing you a loan, credit card, or financing on goods (such as a car or cell phone) or services. Typically, hard inquiries are initiated by lenders after you apply for credit. A hard inquiry can also occur if you’re renting something of significant monetary value (such as an apartment or car) from a company, for example, to determine a security deposit amount for an apartment you want to rent. Generally, hard inquiries are used to evaluate whether you’ll be able to meet your current and potential future financial obligations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoft and hard credit inquiries are recorded in your credit files, where they can remain for up to two years. Each credit bureau records only inquiries it has received, so you may see differences in the inquiry listings on reports from different bureaus. For instance, if you apply for a car loan and the potential lender only checks your Equifax credit report, you’ll see that inquiry on your Equifax credit report, and not on your Experian or TransUnion reports. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow Do Credit Checks Affect My Credit Score?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoft credit pulls won’t impact your credit scores, however hard pulls can. Typically, you may see your credit score temporarily dip by a few points after a lender or credit card issuer does a hard credit check. Hard credit inquiries may stay on your credit report for up to two years, however, they may only affect your score for one year. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy does a hard credit check hurt your credit score?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eStatistics show that taking on new debt makes a borrower more likely to be unable to pay their existing bills. When you apply for new credit, credit scoring models such as FICO\u003csup\u003e®\u003c/sup\u003e Score and VantageScore® typically will recalculate your scores by a few points. If you continue paying your bills on time, your scores can typically bounce back within a few months. Hard credit pulls account for 10% of your overall FICO\u003csup\u003e®\u003c/sup\u003e Score and 5% and 11% of your VantageScore\u003csup\u003e®\u003c/sup\u003e 3.0 and 4.0 scores, respectively. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile hard inquiries can impact your score, other factors carry more weight with some of the popular credit scoring models. Both the FICO\u003csup\u003e®\u003c/sup\u003e Score and VantageScore\u003csup\u003e®\u003c/sup\u003e models rank payment history as one of the most important factors in determining credit scores. Other factors weighted more heavily than hard inquiries include how much you owe and the length of your credit history. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eExamples of Soft Credit Checks\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are some examples of when a new soft inquiry may show up on your credit reports. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e1. Checking your rate with a potential lender\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany lenders let you \u003ca href=\"https://www.lendingclub.com/personal-loan\"\u003echeck your rate\u003c/a\u003e online before you apply. This soft “rate check” can give you a fairly good idea of whether you would qualify for a loan and the potential interest rate and other loan terms you’d potentially receive, without impacting your credit score. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e2. Prescreened offers \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe national credit bureaus provide prescreening and marketing services to a variety of companies such as financial institutions, credit card issuers, and insurance companies. These companies may use credit report data or credit scores to target potential new customers with specific product offers.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you receive a prescreened offer of credit or insurance, you’ll likely see a soft credit check on one of your credit reports.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e3. Checking your own credit report\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing a credit monitoring service or requesting a copy of one of your own credit reports is a soft inquiry. This is why checking your own credit does not hurt your credit score. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e4. Current creditors checking your credit\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreditors also regularly check current customers’ credit reports to monitor their creditworthiness and manage their accounts. For example, your credit card issuer might decide to increase your card’s credit limit if you have a good payment history. Alternatively, the issuer can lower your credit limit if a major drop in credit score suggests you have problems managing your debts. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e5. Prospective or current employers checking your credit\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eCurrent and potential employers may also check your credit reports as part of a background check, but they need to have your written permission first. Credit reports issued to employers omit certain information, such as date of birth. Some states limit or ban the use of credit checks for employment purposes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eExamples of Hard Credit Checks\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned, hard credit checks typically happen when you apply for loans or credit lines, however, you may be subject to a hard credit inquiry in the following situations. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e1. Applying for a loan\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLenders typically conduct a hard credit check if you formally apply for a mortgage, auto loan, student loan, or personal loan. They review your credit to help determine if you\u0026#39;re a lending risk and how likely you are to make your monthly payments. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e2. Applying for a credit card\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA credit card issuer will also do a hard credit pull when you apply for a new credit card. As with lenders, they do this to determine if you’re likely to make your monthly payments on time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e3. Applying for a rental, phone, or utilities (sometimes)\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’ll often undergo a credit check when you apply to rent a home or apartment, open a new phone plan, or start a utility or telecom service. These credit checks are typically soft inquiries. However, it’s important to ask the provider, as sometimes it will be a hard inquiry. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e4. Unauthorized inquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHard inquiries require your permission (which is included in a loan or credit application and more explicitly in employment or rental screenings). If a hard inquiry is run without your permission, it may mean someone has used your personal credentials to apply for credit in your name, for purposes of credit fraud or identity theft. If you believe someone has or is trying to steal your identity, immediately contact the credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) and \u003ca href=\"https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/\"\u003ereport it to the FTC\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProTip: Inquiry entries on credit reports will sometimes list company names or abbreviations that are not immediately recognizable, which can make legitimate inquiries appear unfamiliar. So before assuming something criminal is happening, verify using the contact information included in the inquiry entry on your credit report.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e3 Ways to Reduce the Impact of Hard Inquiries\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re concerned about hard inquiries damaging your credit score, there are a few ways to reduce their impact. Here are some strategies that could help. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e1. Check your rate before applying.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany lenders let you see if you might be eligible for a loan by checking your rates with a soft credit check before you submit, or complete, a formal application. Checking your rate before you apply helps you shop lenders without it impacting your credit scores. Also keep in mind that checking your rate isn’t a guarantee you’ll be approved, but it can help you avoid submitting loan applications that may not work for you. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e2. Be strategic about applications.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re ready to apply for a loan, shopping around by checking your interest rate online can help you find the best rate you can qualify for among a sea of lenders. Fortunately, popular credit scoring models account for rate shopping, as it’s a common and smart strategy for consumers. If you rate shop within a specific timeframe, usually 14-45 days depending on the scoring model, multiple hard inquiries may only count as one. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e3. Focus on improving your credit.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA hard credit check might impact your credit scores, but it’s a minor scoring factor. Focusing on major factors, such as building a long history of on-time payments and only using a small portion of your available revolving credit balances could help improve your overall credit. Once you have a good or excellent credit score, a small and temporary drop might not matter as much. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth soft and hard credit inquiries may appear on your credit report, but these reviews of your credit are typically done for different reasons. For example, if you check your rate for a personal loan, for instance, the lender typically does a soft credit check. However, you’ll be subject to a hard credit check when you formally apply by completing your application. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother key difference between soft vs. hard credit checks: while soft inquiries won’t impact your credit scores, hard inquiries can hurt your scores slightly. Fortunately, any decreases to your scores are temporary and may only impact your scores for up to a year or less.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSoft vs. Hard Credit Check FAQs\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWill checking my own credit score result in a hard credit check?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eChecking your own credit scores will not result in a hard credit check. But it’s important to note that your credit scores do not generally appear on your credit reports. Instead, you may be able to view your credit score for free through your credit card issuer, bank, or a third-party credit scoring service. You can also purchase a report that lets you see your credit score through one of the national credit reporting agencies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWill a soft credit check affect my credit score?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA soft inquiry has no impact on your credit score. If you formally apply for a loan or credit line, your creditor will do a hard credit check, which may cause a temporary, small drop (a couple of points) in one or more of your credit scores. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat does a hard credit inquiry show?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA hard credit check or hard inquiry is a record of when an organization checked one of your credit reports to assess your credit behavior in response to an application for a loan, credit card, auto financing, or lease. A hard inquiry can stay in your credit history for two years, even if you don’t take out a new credit line or loan.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"category":{"label":"Personal Finance","link":"/resource-center/personal-finance"},"publishedDate":"October 3, 2023","subTitle":{"label":"How to Read Your Credit Report: Red Flags and Errors You Should Dispute ","link":"/resource-center/personal-finance/how-to-read-your-credit-report-identify-red-flags"},"description":"Identifying red flags and knowing how to correct inaccuracies in your credit report can help keep your credit score in good shape.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act states that consumer reporting agencies may provide consumer reports only for purposes related to credit, employment, and insurance, and in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, when you apply for new credit and give permission to pull your credit report. Or, if you’re already a customer, the company can continue to review your credit. However, you don’t always have to give permission for a company or person to have a permissible purpose to request a copy of your credit report. For example, a credit bureau doesn’t need your permission to send a copy of your report to an organization in response to a court order. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, if you received a credit card or loan offer in the mail, your contact information was likely part of a prescreened list. Credit bureaus compile prescreened marketing lists based on specific criteria, such as credit records and demographics, and, as a result, you may see a record of a soft credit pull in your credit history. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are limitations on how organizations can use your credit reports, and these may vary from state to state. For example, employers can often request special reports that won’t contain certain personal information (such as your age or your credit score). But in some states, employers are not permitted to review your credit report at all as part of the hiring or promotion process. Also, some states limit how insurers can use credit when offering or pricing insurance policies. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow Your Credit Reports Relate to Your Credit Scores\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour credit reports are often the sole basis for your credit scores.

That’s why learning how to read your credit report and understand what’s included in it is important because the different scoring models will determine your scores based on the same underlying credit report. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou want to make sure there aren’t any errors in your reports, because erroneous negative items could hurt your credit scores. In turn, lower credit scores can make it more difficult to \u003ca href=\"https://www.lendingclub.com/personal-loan\"\u003eget a new loan\u003c/a\u003e or credit card, and lead to higher interest rates if you’re approved. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeep in mind, most credit reports—including the free copies you can obtain once per year through \u003ca href=\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action\"\u003eAnnualCreditReport.com\u003c/a\u003e—will not include your credit scores.

Creditors do this, in part, to incentivize their customers to pay on time (as customers know a late payment can hurt their credit). Additionally, credit bureaus actively collect or purchase data from public records. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat if I\u0026#39;m new to credit?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;ve never applied for or taken out a loan or credit card, your information might not be in the credit bureaus’ credit files. As a result, you might not have a credit report and won’t be “scorable” as the scoring models may not have enough information about you to analyze. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s a good credit score?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eCredit scores commonly range from 300 up to 850. A score in the mid-600s or above may be considered a good score, however, higher scores may make it easier to get approved for a new loan or line of credit with favorable terms. Regardless of your score, creditors will also consider the underlying information in your credit report to make their determination on whether or not to lend. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCan I dispute my credit score?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can\u0026#39;t dispute your credit scores.

A personal loan also may help you avoid overextending your budget because you’ll know exactly how much you have to spend. If you’re looking to consolidate high-interest debt, you could roll all your debt into one personal loan with a fixed rate, term and a single monthly payment. Plus, you\u0026#39;ll know exactly when your debt will be paid off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether you’d like to finance a big project or consolidate debt, here are some of the top reasons to get a personal loan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e4 Good Reasons to Get a Personal Loan\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e1.

It can help you save money by reducing your interest rate or by making it easier to pay off debt faster. A debt consolidation loan may also lower your monthly payment. The reasons for taking out a \u003ca href=\"https://www.lendingclub.com/personal-loan/debt-consolidation\"\u003edebt consolidation personal loan\u003c/a\u003e to pay down debt can vary depending on your circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, you may want to simplify your finances by decreasing your total number of monthly bills. You can do this by paying off multiple high-interest debts with your personal loan (i.e., debt consolidation), leaving you with a single monthly payment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIdeally, you can also save money by finding a personal loan with a lower rate than your current debts. When that’s the case, it can make a lot of sense to refinance a single debt with a lower-rate personal loan, lowering your cost of borrowing money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsolidating and refinancing debts can also change your monthly payment amount. Choosing a personal loan with a shorter term will lead to higher monthly payments, but you’ll also pay off the loan much faster. Generally, you’ll save on interest costs over the life of your loan by choosing a shorter term. A longer term may give you lower monthly payments, which can be easier to manage on a tight budget, but it will cost you more in interest over time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eCredit card refinancing and consolidation\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.lendingclub.com/personal-loan/credit-card-consolidation-loan\"\u003ePaying down multiple credit card balances\u003c/a\u003e, a type of debt refinancing, can be another good reason for a personal loan. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs with loan refinancing, you may be able to save money on the cost of borrowing. For example, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/default.htm\"\u003eFederal Reserve data\u003c/a\u003e, revolving credit card accounts had an average interest rate of 22.16% during the second quarter of 2023; meanwhile, 24-month personal loans had an average 11.48% interest rate during the same period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePersonal loans can also be easier to manage than credit cards, as you generally don’t have to worry about variable rates or variable monthly payments, and you’ll know exactly when the loan will be paid off. Also, paying down credit card debt with a personal loan could decrease your credit utilization rate, a positive factor for your credit scores.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e2.

Relocating your household could cost as much as $10,000 for long-distance moves, according to ConsumerAffairs\u003csup\u003e®\u003c/sup\u003e. However, that’s only the cost associated with hiring movers to transport your belongings.

Good for starting or growing a business.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether you’re starting a new business, freelancing on the side, or are an established business owner, financing can be important to long-term success.

However, for major purchases that will take longer to pay off, a personal loan can provide a competitive, fixed interest rate with predictable monthly payments. These features can make installment loans a good option for financing large purchases while minimizing the impact on your cash flow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhen Not to Use a Personal Loan\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn general, it’s wise to borrow only what you can afford to repay. If another monthly payment will cause you to struggle financially, a personal loan probably isn’t the best choice. Instead, consider saving up for an expense rather than financing it. If the cost is unexpected and you need funds quickly, consider working out a payment plan if possible or borrowing money from a trusted family member or friend.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile you can use personal loans for many purposes, there are some restrictions.

However, whether you should get a personal loan can depend on the loan offer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFortunately, many online banks and lending marketplaces can help you get prequalified with a soft credit check, which allows the lender to review your credit history without impacting your credit scores.

Can I get a personal loan with bad credit?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou might be able to get a personal loan with bad credit, but it might take a few extra steps. For example, you may need to provide additional documentation or apply for a lower personal loan amount than you really need.

It’s important to do your research and check your rate with a few lenders first because the terms, interest rates, APRs, and fees offered by each will vary.

(Transaction accounts are typically checking and regular savings accounts, and don’t include investments, retirement accounts, or other long-term savings that aren’t considered readily accessible.)  \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAverage vs. median savings by age \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore you start worrying about how much is in your own savings account, let’s clarify median vs. average savings by age. \u003ci\u003eMedian\u003c/i\u003e \u003ci\u003esavings\u003c/i\u003e is the middle data point, or the number at which half the people have more in savings and half the people have less. \u003ci\u003eAverage savings \u003c/i\u003eadds up everyone’s savings and divides the total by the number of people surveyed. So for example, nine people with $5,000 in savings and one person with $500,000 would give you an average of $54,500 in savings. As you can see, the average figure can be significantly skewed by a small number of people with much higher balances. This is why median may generally be a more accurate reflection of reality. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBelow, we’ve broken out average and median amounts of savings by age group so you can see how your balance stacks up.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSavings by Age\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth\u003e\u003cp\u003eAge\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\u003cth\u003e\u003cp\u003eAverage Account Balance\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\u003cth\u003e\u003cp\u003eMedian Account Balance\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnder 35 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e$11,250 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e$3,240 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e35 to 44 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e$27,910 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e$4,710 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e45 to 54 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e$48,200 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e$6,400 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e55 to 64 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e$57,670 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e$5,620 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e65 to 74 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e$60,410 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e$8,000 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e75 and older \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e$55,320   \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cp\u003e$9,300 \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eSource: Federal Reserve \u003c/i\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scf/dataviz/scf/table/#series:Transaction_Accounts;demographic:all;population:1;units:median\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cu\u003eSurvey of Consumer Finances\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ci\u003e, 2019.\u003c/i\u003e \u003c/br\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat to Know About Savings at Any Age \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.lendingclub.com/resource-center/personal-savings/fire-movement-financial-independence-retire-early\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eHow much you need to save\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e—and how much you’re \u003ci\u003eable to\u003c/i\u003e save—varies depending on personal factors like your income, education, family situation, lifestyle, and expenses.

Borrowing reduces your available credit, and repayment replenishes your credit limit (minus the interest and fees charged). Revolving credit does not have a fixed number of payments. This differs from installment credit which lets you borrow a lump sum and pay it back over a set number of fixed monthly payments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow Does a Revolving Line of Credit Work?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt helps to think of a revolving line of credit as a renewable source of funds within a set credit limit. The lender sets the credit limit upon application approval. You can use as much of your credit limit as you need, paying interest only on the money you borrow. As you repay what you’ve borrowed (plus interest and fees), your available credit replenishes, and you can continue borrowing against your revolving line up to the credit limit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTypes of Revolving Credit\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most common revolving credit products are lines of credit and credit cards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLines of credit \u003c/b\u003ecome in different forms, including home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), personal lines of credit, and business lines of credit. Credit lines are typically issued by banks and credit unions, and generally you can draw on your line using special checks, ATM, telephone, and online banking. You’ll only pay interest on the money borrowed from your line of credit. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome lines of credit may be limited in how the funds can be used, such as only for balance transfers from credit cards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCredit cards\u003c/b\u003e are revolving credit accounts that, unlike lines of credit, require you make a purchase or cash advance to access your credit line. While card issuers reserve the right to change your credit limit, you can access your available credit as long as your account is in good standing. When you make purchases on a credit card, you can repay the balance in full by the end of your billing cycle to avoid interest charges and fees. If you don’t pay your outstanding balance in full,the balance “revolves,” or rolls over, to the next month and will accrue interest until paid in full. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: Both lines of credit and credit cards can be secured or unsecured. Secured accounts require collateral; unsecured accounts do not. For example, a HELOC uses your home as collateral. Credit cards are typically unsecured, but some secured cards require cash deposits as collateral.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy is Revolving Credit Important?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eRevolving credit offers greater borrowing flexibility than installment credit. For instance, if you get a $10,000 installment loan for a home remodeling project, you typically receive all the money at once and must start repaying on the entire loan balance immediately plus interest on that amount—even if you don’t use the funds right away. If you need more money, you’ll have to apply for a new loan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, if you get a line of credit or credit card with a $10,000 limit, you can draw on it as needed—say, $1,000 in January, $2,000 in April and $1,500 in June­—and interest will accrue only on the amounts you borrow. As you pay back what you’ve borrowed, your available credit is restored up to your credit limit, so you can make future purchases without needing to apply for additional credit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince it doesn’t require fixed monthly payments, revolving credit can also offer greater payment flexibility than installment loans. If money is tight in a particular month, you have the option of only making the minimum payment on a revolving account, potentially making it easier to meet other financial obligations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRevolving credit can also serve as a financial cushion. Even if you never use it, it’s there in case you need quick access to small amounts of cash in an emergency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat Are the Risks of Revolving Credit?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eRevolving credit has some drawbacks you should be aware of.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCollateral risk:\u003c/b\u003e If you fail to make payments on a secured revolving credit account, you could lose your collateral.

For example, with a loan or credit card, it’s the amount of interest (payment you owe) that has been incurred since you made your last payment. With an interest-bearing account or an investment, such as a bond, it\u0026#39;s the interest (income you earned) that has accumulated since the last time you received a payment from the financial institution or bond issuer. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow Does Accrued Interest Work? \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe way accrued interest works depends on several factors, including the type of account, the balance or principal, the interest rate, timing, and whether you are borrowing money (such as with credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans), or earning money (such as with interest-bearing checking or savings accounts).  \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAccrued Interest on Loans \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePersonal loans, auto loans, and other types of debt charge interest to their borrowers. Most lenders use the simple interest method of accounting, which means that interest that accrues each day is based only on the principal balance of the loan and doesn\u0026#39;t compound on previously accrued interest. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, on a personal loan, the interest on your debt accumulates daily based on your current loan balance and interest rate.  When you make a loan payment, a portion of your total payment amount goes toward the interest that has accrued since your last payment and the remainder goes toward paying down the principal balance of your loan. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have a fixed interest rate, the daily interest amount will go down over time as your principal amount owed decreases with on time payments. With variable rate loans, the amount of interest that accumulates can fluctuate along with the loan\u0026#39;s interest rate, however there\u0026#39;s generally a downward trend with timely payments.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAccrued Interest on Bank Accounts \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGenerally, with interest-bearing deposit accounts, such as a high-yield checking or savings account, interest typically accumulates daily and is paid out monthly. The amount of interest that accrues is based on your balance and the account\u0026#39;s annual percentage yield or APY (which may adjust higher or lower as rates rise or fall) and compounding interest. The higher the APY and your balance, the more you\u0026#39;ll earn. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso, most banks and savings institutions will compound the interest you earn, usually daily. This means that the interest that accrues each day is based not only on your principal account balance but also on the interest that has accumulated since the last payment.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, let\u0026#39;s say you have a $10,000 balance in a savings account with an interest rate of 5%.

This calculation is known as yield to maturity. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterest on bonds does not compound; that is, you don’t earn interest on your interest. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow Accrued Interest Affects Borrowers \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you borrow money, understanding accrued interest gives you an idea of how your loan\u0026#39;s costs are incurred. As you make your regular monthly payments, for instance, the amount of interest that accumulates over time decreases. And if you make additional principal payments on top of your regular payments, you can reduce how much interest accrues even more.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeep in mind that, if you make an extra payment on a loan the lender may use some of that money to pay off the interest that has accrued since your last regular payment unless you specify otherwise. You can request that the lender put the full amount of your additional payment toward the principal balance, saving you more money on interest in the long run. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding how accrued interest works is particularly important if you have student loans. While college students aren\u0026#39;t typically required to make monthly payments while they\u0026#39;re still in school, interest accrues from the moment the loans are disbursed.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor borrowers with federal subsidized loans, the federal government will typically pay interest that accrues while they\u0026#39;re in school and during future deferment periods. If you have unsubsidized loans or private student loans, all the interest that accumulates while you\u0026#39;re in school (and during periods of deferment or forbearance) is added to your balance once repayment begins.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to avoid a growing balance, consider making interest-only payments while you\u0026#39;re still in school. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow Accrued Interest Benefits Savers \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have an interest-bearing deposit account, look into how often (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually) your financial institution compounds the interest that accrues in your account. The more frequently interest is compounded (e.g., daily vs. quarterly) makes it possible for you to earn more interest more quickly. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd if you\u0026#39;ve invested in bonds, understanding how accrued interest works can help ensure that you get the money you\u0026#39;ve earned, especially if you sell the bond between scheduled interest payments. For example, if you sell a bond three months after your last payment, you won\u0026#39;t receive the amount of interest that accrued during that time. Because the buyer will receive the full semi-annual (every six months) interest payment despite only owning the bond for three months, they should pay you the amount that has accrued since your last payment on top of the price of the bond. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow Is Accrued Interest Calculated? \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn loans, lenders generally calculate interest on a daily basis using either a 360-day or 365-day year. The lender will divide the loan\u0026#39;s interest rate by one of those numbers to determine your daily interest rate, which it then applies to your balance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn interest-bearing deposit accounts, interest generally accrues daily. Depending on how often your financial institution compounds interest, the amount that accrues each day may be calculated based on the principal balance plus previously accrued interest. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat Is an Example of Accrued Interest?  \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#39;s say you have a personal loan with a $20,000 principal balance and a 12% interest rate.

In contrast, variable interest rates fluctuate based on market conditions and may change at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat Benefits Do Fixed Interest Rates Offer?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e Having a fixed rate loan offers several benefits for your finances.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFinancial Predictability. \u003c/b\u003eA fixed interest rate makes it easier to plan your finances since your monthly payments don’t fluctuate over the fixed period, usually the life of the loan. Such predictable payments can  help you more easily manage your budget and alleviate stress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEliminate Interest Rate Risk. \u003c/b\u003eWith a fixed interest rate, you don\u0026#39;t have to worry if interest rates start to increase in a volatile economy. Compared to loans with variable rates, a fixed-rate loan with a lower interest rate could save you money in a rising interest rate environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePotentially Lower Borrowing Costs. \u003c/b\u003eWith fixed-rate loans, you’ll know your total borrowing costs—including interest and fees—before you sign your loan documents. With variable-rate loans, it’s difficult to calculate your total borrowing costs since your interest rate may change substantially over time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat Are the Drawbacks to Fixed Interest Rates?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile a fixed interest rate can help you plan your finances for the long term, there are a few drawbacks to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePotentially Higher Rates. \u003c/b\u003eAdjustable-rate financial products often have lower interest rates for an initial, introductory fixed period which may temporarily lower your cost to borrow.

It’s  important to compare the total cost of borrowing of your existing versus a potentially new loan before making a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat Can You Do to Get a Good Fixed Interest Rate?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGenerally, having a high credit score and a demonstrated track record of responsible debt management can help you land a lower fixed interest rate. In contrast, if you have a low credit score and a spotty history of on-time payments, the lender may view you as a higher-risk borrower and may not offer you the best fixed interest rate they have available.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCan You Switch from a Variable Interest Rate to a Fixed Interest Rate?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn most cases, you can\u0026#39;t switch from a variable to a fixed interest rate on an existing loan. While you may be able to refinance your loan—either with your current lender or a new one—and move to a fixed-rate loan that way, it’s important to consider how well you would be able to cope with economic uncertainty. A low variable rates may be tempting initially, but should economic conditions sour and rates begin to rise rapidly, it may be difficult to find a good fixed rate when you want one. Or you may experience an unexpected obstacle, like job loss, that could make refinancing into a fixed interest rate loan difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAre Credit Card Interest Rates Fixed?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eGenerally, credit card interest rates are variable, not fixed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAre Student Loan Interest Rates Fixed?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt depends on the type of student loan.
