Unless you direct your payment to an individual loan or loan group, the standard allocation method is followed. You can also direct payments (including partial payments) to individual loans or groups, as a one-time or recurring special payment instruction. For more information see &amp;ldquo;Can I direct payments to loans or loan groups?&amp;rdquo; below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment Allocation for Loans in Repayment Status:&lt;/strong&gt; You can direct payments (including partial payments) to individual loans or groups as a one-time or recurring special payment instruction. See &amp;ldquo;Can I direct payments to loans or loan groups?&amp;rdquo; below for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a portion of a payment is allocated to a specific loan group, payments are applied to individual loans proportionally to fees first (if applicable)*, then interest, and then to principal. If you are on an Income-Based Repayment Plan, payments are applied to interest, then fees (if applicable)*, and then to principal. Refer to &lt;a href=&quot; https://www.nelnet.com/how-payments-are-allocated&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; How Payments Are Allocated &lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying Your Current Amount Due:&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you direct your payment to an individual loan or loan group, the standard allocation method is as follows. Payments are allocated first to any past due groups. Once all groups are up to date, payments are allocated across groups in an active repayment status, in proportion to each group&amp;rsquo;s regular monthly payment amount, less any amount already paid for that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying More Than Your Current Amount Due:&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you direct your payment to an individual loan or group, the standard allocation method is as follows. After your current amount due is paid, payments are allocated across loans starting with the highest interest rate. Once the loans with the highest interest rate are paid in full, any remaining payment amount will be allocated across the loans with the next highest interest rate. If two or more loans have the same highest interest rate, the payment will be allocated first to the unsubsidized loans and then to the subsidized loans, in proportion to each loan&amp;rsquo;s regular monthly payment amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you pay more than your current amount due, your due date on loan groups in repayment status will advance by one month each time you satisfy the regular monthly payment amount for that group. Your monthly billing statement will show $0 due for that loan group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since your excess payment will continue to be applied to the loan group starting with the highest interest rate, you will continue to have an amount due for loan groups with lower interest rates.**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have the option to request that we not advance your due date when you pay more than your current amount due. See &amp;ldquo;Can I direct payments to loans or loan groups?&amp;rdquo; below for more information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want your excess payment to continue to advance the due date of all of your loan groups in repayment status, you can direct your excess payments to all loan groups in repayment status, instead of targeting the loan group(s) with the highest interest rate, as a one-time or recurring special payment instruction. This will help keep the due dates for all loan groups aligned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying Less Than Your Current Amount Due:&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you direct your payment to an individual loan or loan group, the standard allocation method is as follows. Payments are allocated first to past due groups. If the current amount due is not paid, payments are allocated across group(s) from most to least delinquent, in proportion to each group&amp;rsquo;s regular monthly payment amount, less any amount already paid for that month until each loan group is at the same level of delinquency or all groups are up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not pay the current amount due, every loan group may become delinquent, be reported to consumer reporting agencies, be subject to late fees (if applicable)*, and may lose eligibility for borrower benefits depending on your lender&amp;rsquo;s guidelines. We encourage you to pay as much as you can, because interest accrues daily on your outstanding principal balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment Allocation for Loans Not in Repayment Status:&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you direct your payment to an individual loan or loan group, the standard allocation method is as follows. If none of your loans are in repayment status, payments are allocated across loans starting with the highest interest rate, unless the payment is made within 120 days of disbursement (see below). Once the loans with the highest interest rate are paid in full, any remaining payment amount will be allocated across the loans with the next highest interest rate. If two or more loans have the same highest interest rate, the payment will be allocated first to the unsubsidized loans and then to the subsidized loans, in proportion to each loan&amp;rsquo;s regular monthly payment amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payments Made Within 120 Days of Disbursement:&lt;/strong&gt; When you make a payment within 120 days of the date your school disbursed your loan funds (the disbursement date), your payment is first applied to the original principal balance of that disbursement(s) which, in turn, reduces the amount of your loan. There is also a prorated reduction of the default/origination fee based on your payment amount. Please note, this excludes loans that are already in repayment status and consolidation loans. If a payment made within 120 days of a disbursement pays the original principal balance of that loan\&#39;s disbursement amount in full, any additional payment amount will be allocated according to the standard allocation method, as noted above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The U.S. Department of Education does not assess late or returned payment fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**If you are enrolled in auto debit, payments will be deducted each month that your loans are in an active repayment status as noted on your monthly billing statement, even if you have paid more than the current amount due (known as being paid ahead). Payments will not auto debit for loans that are paid ahead while on an Income-Based, Income-Contingent, Pay As You Earn, or Revised Pay As You Earn repayment plan, or in a Reduced Payment Forbearance. If all of your loans are in one of these repayment plans, only your regular monthly payment amount as noted on your monthly billing statement will be automatically deducted.&lt;/p&gt;','payNowDisclaimer2Display':'true','payNowDisclaimer3Title':'Can I direct payments to loans or loan groups?','payNowDisclaimer3Body':'&lt;p&gt;Yes, you have the option to request your payments be allocated differently than the standard payment allocation method, as a one-time or recurring special payment instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You are making a payment (including partial payments) and would like to direct it to individual loans or loan groups.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to direct future online payments to an individual loan instead of directing to a loan group, you may request that your loans be ungrouped by calling us at the number above. For more information on making online payments, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nelnet.com/how-to-make-a-payment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; How To Make a Payment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;','payNowDisclaimer3Display':'true','payNowDisclaimer4Title':'How is my due date advanced?','payNowDisclaimer4Body':'&lt;p&gt;While in repayment, each time you pay a loan group\&#39;s regular monthly payment amount, we will advance your due date by one month (see example below). If you make a partial payment, your current amount due will be reduced by the amount already paid. If your current amount due on an Income-Driven Repayment Plan is $0, prepayments will not advance your due date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always pay more without penalty, which will reduce your total cost of borrowing and save you money in the long run. If you are not required to make a payment this month, you won&amp;rsquo;t be considered past due if you don&amp;rsquo;t make a payment or pay less than your regular monthly payment amount. However, &lt;strong&gt;we encourage you to continue paying as much as you can even if your current amount due is $0 because interest may continue to accrue on your outstanding principal balance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To maintain eligibility for borrower benefits and repayment incentives, you may be required to continue making monthly payments even if your current amount due is $0. For more information about prepayments and how they qualify toward benefits, repayment incentives, or loan forgiveness you may be eligible for, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nelnet.com/contact/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also have the option to instruct us to not advance your due date more than one month, as a one-time or recurring special payment instruction. By selecting this option, your due date will only advance a single month, even though you have paid more than the current amount due. If your account is already paid ahead, selecting this option will keep your due date from advancing further, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nelnet.com/contact/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; contact us&lt;/a&gt; if you want your regular monthly payment amount to be due the next month.&lt;/strong&gt; See &amp;ldquo;Can I direct payments to loans or loan groups?&amp;rdquo; above for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: If your current amount due in August is $50 and you make an online payment for $100, your next payment will be due in October, because $100 pays the amount due in August and September. This does not restrict you from still making a payment in September, if you wish. We encourage you to continue making monthly payments because interest may continue to accrue on your outstanding principal balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; Any person who knowingly makes a false statement or misrepresentation on this online request or on any accompanying document is subject to penalties that may include fines, imprisonment, or both, under the U.S. Criminal Code and 20 U.S.C. 1097.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE FORM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you are completing the online version of this form, you may be required to submit supporting documents. Your deferment will not be processed until we receive all required information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECTION 6: DEFINITIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt; William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program&lt;/strong&gt; includes Federal Direct Stafford/Ford (Direct Subsidized) Loans, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/ Ford (Direct Unsubsidized) Loans, Federal Direct PLUS (Direct PLUS) Loans, and Federal Direct Consolidation (Direct Consolidation) Loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt; Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program&lt;/strong&gt; includes Federal Stafford Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Federal Consolidation Loans, and Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt; Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program&lt;/strong&gt; includes Federal Perkins Loans, National Direct Student Loans (NDSL), and National Defense Student Loans (Defense Loans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;authorized official&lt;/strong&gt; who may complete Section 4 is an official of the Rehabilitation Training Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capitalization&lt;/strong&gt; is the addition of unpaid interest to the principal balance of your loan. Capitalization causes more interest to accrue over the life of your loan and may cause your monthly payment amount to increase. Interest never capitalizes on Perkins Loans. Table 1 (below) provides an example of the monthly payments and the total amount repaid for a $30,000 unsubsidized loan. The example loan has a 6% interest rate and the example deferment or forbearance lasts for 12 months and begins when the loan entered repayment. The example compares the effects of paying the interest as it accrues or allowing it to capitalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;co-maker&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the two individuals who are joint borrowers on a Direct or Federal Consolidation Loan or a Federal PLUS Loan. Both co-makers are equally responsible for repaying the full amount of the loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;deferment&lt;/strong&gt; is a period during which you are entitled to postpone repayment of your loans. Interest is not generally charged to you during a deferment on your subsidized loans. Interest is always charged to you during a deferment on your unsubsidized loans. On loans made under the Perkins Loan Program, all deferments are followed by a post-deferment grace period of 6 months, during which time you are not required to make payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;forbearance&lt;/strong&gt; is a period during which you are permitted to postpone making payments temporarily, allowed an extension of time for making payments, or temporarily allowed to make smaller payments than scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;holder&lt;/strong&gt; of your Direct Loans is the Department. The holder of your FFEL Program loans may be a lender, guaranty agency, secondary market, or the Department. The holder of your Perkins Loans is an institution of higher education or the Department. Your loan holder may use a servicer to handle billing and other communications related to your loans. References to &amp;ldquo;your loan holder&amp;rdquo; on this form mean either your loan holder or your servicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;subsidized loan&lt;/strong&gt; is a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct Subsidized Consolidation Loan, a Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan, portions of some Federal Consolidation Loans, a Federal Perkins Loan, an NDSL, and a Defense Loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;unsubsidized loan&lt;/strong&gt; is a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, a Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, a Federal PLUS Loan, a Federal SLS, and portions of some Federal Consolidation Loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Act Notice&lt;/strong&gt;. The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) requires that the following notice be provided to you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authorities for collecting the requested information from and about you are &amp;sect;421 et seq., &amp;sect;451 et seq., or &amp;sect;461 et seq. of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq., 20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq., or 20 U.S.C. 1087aa et seq.) and the authorities for collecting and using your Social Security Number (SSN) are &amp;sect;&amp;sect;428B(f) and 484(a)(4) of the HEA (20 U.S.C. 1078-2(f) and 1091(a)(4)) and 31 U.S.C. 7701(b). Participating in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, or Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program and giving us your SSN are voluntary, but you must provide the requested information, including your SSN, to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal purposes for collecting the information on this form, including your SSN, are to verify your identity, to determine your eligibility to receive a loan or a benefit on a loan (such as a deferment, forbearance, discharge, or forgiveness) under the Direct Loan, FFEL, or Federal Perkins Loan Programs, to permit the servicing of your loans, and, if it becomes necessary, to locate you and to collect and report on your loans if your loans become delinquent or default. We also use your SSN as an account identifier and to permit you to access your account information electronically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information in your file may be disclosed, on a case-by-case basis or under a computer matching program, to third parties as authorized under routine uses in the appropriate systems of records notices. The routine uses of this information include, but are not limited to, its disclosure to federal, state, or local agencies, to private parties such as relatives, present and former employers, business and personal associates, to consumer reporting agencies, to financial and educational institutions, and to guaranty agencies in order to verify your identity, to determine your eligibility to receive a loan or a benefit on a loan, to permit the servicing or collection of your loans, to enforce the terms of the loans, to investigate possible fraud and to verify compliance with federal student financial aid program regulations, or to locate you if you become delinquent in your loan payments or if you default. To provide default rate calculations, disclosures may be made to guaranty agencies, to financial and educational institutions, or to state agencies. To provide financial aid history information, disclosures may be made to educational institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assist program administrators with tracking refunds and cancellations, disclosures may be made to guaranty agencies, to financial and educational institutions, or to federal or state agencies. To provide a standardized method for educational institutions to efficiently submit student enrollment statuses, disclosures may be made to guaranty agencies or to financial and educational institutions. To counsel you in repayment efforts, disclosures may be made to guaranty agencies, to financial and educational institutions, or to federal, state, or local agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event of litigation, we may send records to the Department of Justice, a court, adjudicative body, counsel, party, or witness if the disclosure is relevant and necessary to the litigation. If this information, either alone or with other information, indicates a potential violation of law, we may send it to the appropriate authority for action. We may send information to members of Congress if you ask them to help you with federal student aid questions. In circumstances involving employment complaints, grievances, or disciplinary actions, we may disclose relevant records to adjudicate or investigate the issues. If provided for by a collective bargaining agreement, we may disclose records to a labor organization recognized under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 71. Disclosures may be made to our contractors for the purpose of performing any programmatic function that requires disclosure of records. Before making any such disclosure, we will require the contractor to maintain Privacy Act safeguards. Disclosures may also be made to qualified researchers under Privacy Act safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paperwork Reduction Notice&lt;/strong&gt;. According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number. The valid OMB control number for this information collection is 1845-0011. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 10 minutes per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The obligation to respond to this collection is required to obtain a benefit in accordance with 34 CFR 674.34, 674.35, 674.36, 674.37, 682.210, or 685.204.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Act Notice&lt;/strong&gt;. The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) requires that the following notice be provided to you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authorities for collecting the requested information from and about you are &amp;sect;421 et seq., &amp;sect;451 et seq., or &amp;sect;461 et seq. of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq., 20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq., or 20 U.S.C. 1087aa et seq.) and the authorities for collecting and using your Social Security Number (SSN) are &amp;sect;&amp;sect;428B(f) and 484(a)(4) of the HEA (20 U.S.C. 1078-2(f) and 1091(a)(4)) and 31 U.S.C. 7701(b). Participating in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, or Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program and giving us your SSN are voluntary, but you must provide the requested information, including your SSN, to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal purposes for collecting the information on this form, including your SSN, are to verify your identity, to determine your eligibility to receive a loan or a benefit on a loan (such as a deferment, forbearance, discharge, or forgiveness) under the Direct Loan, FFEL, or Federal Perkins Loan Programs, to permit the servicing of your loans, and, if it becomes necessary, to locate you and to collect and report on your loans if your loans become delinquent or default. We also use your SSN as an account identifier and to permit you to access your account information electronically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information in your file may be disclosed, on a case-by-case basis or under a computer matching program, to third parties as authorized under routine uses in the appropriate systems of records notices. The routine uses of this information include, but are not limited to, its disclosure to federal, state, or local agencies, to private parties such as relatives, present and former employers, business and personal associates, to consumer reporting agencies, to financial and educational institutions, and to guaranty agencies in order to verify your identity, to determine your eligibility to receive a loan or a benefit on a loan, to permit the servicing or collection of your loans, to enforce the terms of the loans, to investigate possible fraud and to verify compliance with federal student financial aid program regulations, or to locate you if you become delinquent in your loan payments or if you default. To provide default rate calculations, disclosures may be made to guaranty agencies, to financial and educational institutions, or to state agencies. To provide financial aid history information, disclosures may be made to educational institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assist program administrators with tracking refunds and cancellations, disclosures may be made to guaranty agencies, to financial and educational institutions, or to federal or state agencies. To provide a standardized method for educational institutions to efficiently submit student enrollment statuses, disclosures may be made to guaranty agencies or to financial and educational institutions. To counsel you in repayment efforts, disclosures may be made to guaranty agencies, to financial and educational institutions, or to federal, state, or local agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event of litigation, we may send records to the Department of Justice, a court, adjudicative body, counsel, party, or witness if the disclosure is relevant and necessary to the litigation. If this information, either alone or with other information, indicates a potential violation of law, we may send it to the appropriate authority for action. We may send information to members of Congress if you ask them to help you with federal student aid questions. In circumstances involving employment complaints, grievances, or disciplinary actions, we may disclose relevant records to adjudicate or investigate the issues. If provided for by a collective bargaining agreement, we may disclose records to a labor organization recognized under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 71. Disclosures may be made to our contractors for the purpose of performing any programmatic function that requires disclosure of records. Before making any such disclosure, we will require the contractor to maintain Privacy Act safeguards. Disclosures may also be made to qualified researchers under Privacy Act safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paperwork Reduction Notice&lt;/strong&gt;. According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number. The valid OMB control number for this information collection is 1845-0011. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 10 minutes per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The obligation to respond to this collection is required to obtain a benefit in accordance with 34 CFR 674.34, 674.35, 674.36, 674.37, 682.210, or 685.204.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program / Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program / Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; Any person who knowingly makes a false statement or misrepresentation on this online request or on any accompanying document is subject to penalties that may include fines, imprisonment, or both, under the U.S. Criminal Code and 20 U.S.C. 1097.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE FORM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you are completing the online version of this form, you may be required to submit supporting documents. Your deferment will not be processed until we receive all required information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECTION 5: DEFINITIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program&lt;/strong&gt; includes Federal Direct Stafford/Ford (Direct Subsidized) Loans, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford (Direct Unsubsidized) Loans, Federal Direct PLUS (Direct PLUS) Loans, and Federal Direct Consolidation (Direct Consolidation) Loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program&lt;/strong&gt; includes Federal Stafford Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Federal Consolidation Loans, and Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program&lt;/strong&gt; includes Federal Perkins Loans, National Direct Student Loans (NDSL), and National Defense Student Loans (Defense Loans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capitalization&lt;/strong&gt; is the addition of unpaid interest to the principal balance of your loan. Capitalization causes more interest to accrue over the life of your loan and may cause your monthly payment amount to increase. Interest never capitalizes on Perkins Loans. Table 1 (below) provides an example of the monthly payments and the total amount repaid for a $30,000 unsubsidized loan. The example loan has a 6% interest rate and the example deferment or forbearance lasts for 12 months and begins when the loan entered repayment. The example compares the effects of paying the interest as it accrues or allowing it to capitalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;co-maker&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the two individuals who are joint borrowers on a Direct or Federal Consolidation Loan or a Federal PLUS Loan. Both co-makers are equally responsible for repaying the full amount of the loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;deferment&lt;/strong&gt; is a period during which you are entitled to postpone repayment of your loans. Interest is not generally charged to you during a deferment on your subsidized loans. Interest is always charged to you during a deferment on your unsubsidized loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On loans made under the Perkins Loan Program, all deferments are followed by a post-deferment grace period of 6 months, during which time you are not required to make payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;forbearance &lt;/strong&gt;is a period during which you are permitted to postpone making payments temporarily, allowed an extension of time for making payments, or temporarily allowed to make smaller payments than scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full-time employment&lt;/strong&gt; means working 30 or more hours a week in a position expected to last at least 3 consecutive months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;holder &lt;/strong&gt; of your Direct Loans is the Department. The holder of your FFEL Program loans may be a lender, guaranty agency, secondary market, or the Department. The holder of your Perkins Loans is an institution of higher education or the Department. Your loan holder may use a servicer to handle billing and other communications related to your loans. References to &amp;ldquo;your loan holder&amp;rdquo; on this form mean either your loan holder or your servicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;subsidized loan &lt;/strong&gt;is a Direct Subsidized Loan, a Direct Subsidized Consolidation Loan, a Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan, portions of some Federal Consolidation Loans, a Federal Perkins Loan, an NDSL, and a Defense Loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;unsubsidized loan&lt;/strong&gt; is a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, a Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, a Federal PLUS Loan, a Federal SLS, and portions of some Federal Consolidation Loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;United States &lt;/strong&gt;includes any US State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, and US military bases and embassies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;m-t-none&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply for Student Debt Relief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATED 10/18/2022&lt;/p&gt;
The&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Biden-Harris Student Debt Relief application&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is now available. Nelnet accounts beginning with E are eligible. You can apply for debt relief until the end of next year, December 31,&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;. Visit&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.studentaid.gov/debtrelief&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;StudentAid.gov/debtrelief&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the latest information and qualifications.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;p-l-md p-r-md&quot;&gt;For help completing the form, call Federal Student Loan Debt Relief Support at 833.932.3439. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here\&#39;s what to expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FSA will notify you when your application is approved and has been sent to Nelnet to process your debt relief, which could take several weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nelnet will send you an email or letter when the debt relief has been applied to your loan(s). It may take some time for your Nelnet account to reflect this change. We appreciate your patience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a remaining loan balance after the debt relief is applied, we will recalculate your monthly payment based on your new balance, potentially reducing your monthly payment. Nelnet will communicate your new payment amount to you once repayment resumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;m-t-none&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Debt Relief Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATED 10/18/2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Biden-Harris Administration has announced a plan that includes debt relief depending on income. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) is assessing whether there are alternative pathways to provide relief for borrowers with federal student loans not held by ED, including FFEL Program loans (Nelnet accounts beginning with D or J) and Perkins loans and is discussing this with commercial lenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct Consolidation loans comprised of any FFEL or Perkins loans not held by ED are eligible for debt relief, as long as the borrower applied for consolidation before September 29, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

<p>Great Lakes has transferred its entire portfolio of federal student loans to Nelnet and is no longer a student loan servicer. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) authorized this transfer and has posted a notice about it at <a href="http://www.studentaid.gov/greatlakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StudentAid.gov/greatlakes</a>. Your loan was not sold. ED will continue to own your loan; however, Nelnet will manage your loan and assist you on ED&rsquo;s behalf as your federal student loan servicer. This change will not impact the existing status, terms, conditions, interest rate, or available repayment plans of your federal student loan.</p>

<div class="collapse p-l-sm anchor" id="student-loan-servicer">
<p>A student loan servicer provides you with the tools and resources you need from the point your first loan amount is disbursed (delivered) by your school, to the point that the balance on your loan(s) is paid in full, discharged, or forgiven. A servicer&rsquo;s role includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping you up-to-date with information about your student loan(s).</li>
<li>Helping you find the best repayment plan for your budget.</li>
<li>Processing payments.</li>
<li>Helping you understand the various repayment relief options if you&rsquo;re unable to make payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind a servicer never charges to provide assistance with your student loans. There are companies that will offer to help you manage your debt for a fee &ndash; we offer the same services for free! <a href="/contact">Contact Nelnet</a> for help instead.
