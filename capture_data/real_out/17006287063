She was especially influenced by her friend and mentor Anthony Sinsay, a beloved San Diego chef and advocate for Filipino cuisine who passed away in 2021.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started at Animae as a sous chef at the end of 2020. The head chef moved on right before I came, and then before the next COVID closure, I had been running the restaurant by myself for about a month. I became the leader of this restaurant after arriving here in a short period of time. I guess the owners saw a lot of potential from that short period, and I became executive chef in the summer of 2021. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnybody who\u0026#8217;s known me in the industry—they know who I am. I have always kind of been in the background, but they\u0026#8217;ve always known me as a hard worker and somebody who had talent. Chef Carlos Anthony had mentioned they were looking for an executive chef. And I was like, \u0026#8220;No, no, no, no, no, I\u0026#8217;m not ready yet.\u0026#8221; He was like, \u0026#8220;You\u0026#8217;re ready. You have so many good ideas. Just try it.\u0026#8221; It went from me trying it, to creating a full menu, to executing the menu. When I finally did say yes to this job, everybody around me was like, \u0026#8220;Well, it\u0026#8217;s about time!\u0026#8221; I\u0026#8217;m like, \u0026#8220;I wish somebody else told me!\u0026#8221; Sometimes it takes other people to tell you before you even know yourself that you\u0026#8217;re ready for something. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9970\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9970\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/06/51c54df2-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-portrait.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"932\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9970\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/51c54df2-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-portrait.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/51c54df2-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/51c54df2-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-portrait-768x511.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/51c54df2-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-portrait-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9970\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eExecutive chef Tara Monsod at Animae restaurant in San Diego. Photo: Megan Morello.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did a month and a half of menu planning and testing, and then they were like, \u0026#8220;Okay, we\u0026#8217;re going to open two weeks.\u0026#8221; And in that two-week period, we got a whole team back and trained them and all that stuff. We bounced right back. Then we opened the restaurant with me as the new face. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think ever since then, the restaurant has a whole new identity, especially for the Filipino community or the Asian community, period. The representation for them, and having Asian food done well in an environment like this—I hate to say it, but a lot of Asian fusion restaurants sometimes miss the mark. There\u0026#8217;s just something missing. And you don\u0026#8217;t see Filipino food like this, in a dining room like this. It\u0026#8217;s not even just a Filipino menu. It\u0026#8217;s an all-Asian menu, an Asian-American menu. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the fact that there is Filipino food on the menu, and it actually does taste good, means they\u0026#8217;ll stand behind that dish. The Filipinos are the hardest critics because they want it done right. The aunts and uncles that come here let me know that they can make all this at home. I\u0026#8217;m like, \u0026#8220;Look, I know you can make it at home. But just try it out. It\u0026#8217;s different. It\u0026#8217;s not at home, but that\u0026#8217;s the whole point. It\u0026#8217;s an ode to the original, but elevated in a way that it\u0026#8217;s still delicious but different. You can\u0026#8217;t make that at home, but you\u0026#8217;ll like it. Otherwise I might as well just go to your house and eat.\u0026#8221; They just laugh. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9972\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9972\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/06/97bac300-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"733\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9972\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/97bac300-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-kitchen.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/97bac300-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-kitchen-300x157.jpg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/97bac300-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-kitchen-768x402.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/97bac300-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-kitchen-1024x536.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9972\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Megan Morello.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I took over, Animae didn\u0026#8217;t have a true identity in terms of what exactly the food was. Is it a steakhouse? Is it an Asian fusion restaurant? Should I go more steakhouse-y? Should I go food that I like to eat? Is it too casual? Should we go family style? Should we go tiny plates? I thought of all sorts of things. But in the end I was like, I just want to make food that people can gather around. It\u0026#8217;s very eye-appealing, but also not too pretentious where you almost feel uncomfortable being in here. Something a little more warm, a little more welcoming, but fun, all at the same time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Asian folks or people of color, sometimes places like this can be intimidating. I know for my parents it was. I can\u0026#8217;t speak for everybody, but a lot of people don\u0026#8217;t come in here because they feel like it\u0026#8217;s made for a certain type of people, or you need to have money, or you don\u0026#8217;t look like the person next to you. My goal was to make it so that all people, whoever they are, feel welcome to eat here. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for Asians or for Filipinos especially, some of whom are really surprised that our food is in a place like this, I\u0026#8217;m like, \u0026#8220;Why not, dude?\u0026#8221; You see Japanese food done this way. You see Chinese food done this way. Why can\u0026#8217;t we be on the map? And some say, \u0026#8220;Well, our food is meant to be cheap.\u0026#8221; I\u0026#8217;m like, \u0026#8220;Yes, it is cheap. But that\u0026#8217;s because a lot of food is meant to be cheap.

It\u0026#8217;s making your dollar worth it.\u0026#8221; I get it, but that doesn\u0026#8217;t mean that you can\u0026#8217;t elevate it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9973\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9973\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/06/76b56b01-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-hands-cutting.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9973\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/76b56b01-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-hands-cutting.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/76b56b01-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-hands-cutting-150x150.jpg 150w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/76b56b01-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-hands-cutting-300x300.jpg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/76b56b01-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-hands-cutting-768x768.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/76b56b01-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-hands-cutting-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9973\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Megan Morello.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a second to figure all this out, but I trusted what I like to do and what I\u0026#8217;ve been doing. I think that works better than trying to recreate something, because it\u0026#8217;s me. It\u0026#8217;s me on the plate, and it\u0026#8217;s the most honest thing on the plate. That\u0026#8217;s what people respond to the most, because there\u0026#8217;s a story behind it. Those stories I can tell to the servers, and the servers understand that, and they relate that to the guests. People want to connect to something. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was working for Anthony Sinsay 10 years ago at Burlap, which was another Brian Malarkey restaurant. To come back to the Malarkey restaurant group with Animae, I’ve come full circle. Anthony was very passionate about trying to put Filipino food on the map. That\u0026#8217;s why I went to work for him. I knew I wanted to do something with Filipino food, but I didn\u0026#8217;t know exactly what I could do. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony had a great respect for what it is to be a leader. He was definitely one to put his heart on a plate, for sure. That\u0026#8217;s something that any of us who worked for him learned the most. When someone puts their heart into something, other people want to work hard for them. The biggest thing I took for him—and it\u0026#8217;s not necessarily just cooking—was how to lead a team. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9951\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9951\" style=\"width: 1040px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/06/5cb1c8ad-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-anthony-sinsay.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1040\" height=\"1057\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9951\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/5cb1c8ad-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-anthony-sinsay.jpg 1040w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/5cb1c8ad-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-anthony-sinsay-295x300.jpg 295w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/5cb1c8ad-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-anthony-sinsay-768x781.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/5cb1c8ad-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-anthony-sinsay-1008x1024.jpg 1008w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9951\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eTara Monsod and Anthony Sinsay.

He was proud of me that I was working with our food, especially here in San Diego, where we have one of the biggest Filipino communities in California. It\u0026#8217;s nice to see that his efforts weren\u0026#8217;t wasted on me. I\u0026#8217;m trying to continue the same message. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0026#8217;s going well, because Filipino food is going through a renaissance. \u003ca href=\"https://www.theinfatuation.com/chicago/reviews/kasama\"\u003eKasama\u003c/a\u003e in Chicago just got their first Michelin star, and it\u0026#8217;s the first Filipino restaurant in America to get a star. I think that\u0026#8217;s amazing. What\u0026#8217;s cool about the Filipino community is that we\u0026#8217;re uplifting each other versus trying to compete. We\u0026#8217;re like, \u0026#8220;You got it! Fuck, yeah, you got it! Let\u0026#8217;s go!\u0026#8221; People like that will pave the way for the rest of us. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s crazy, but I\u0026#8217;m more proud of our culture in the kitchen than of our food. Of course I\u0026#8217;m proud of our food, but what I\u0026#8217;m proudest of is what we\u0026#8217;re building here. When people leave here, I want them to be as good as me, if not better. Planting those seeds around San Diego, hopefully this is a future culinary scene where people will push the envelope even more. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9974\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9974\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/06/8bc0c580-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-staff.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"963\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9974\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/8bc0c580-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-staff.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/8bc0c580-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-staff-300x206.jpg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/8bc0c580-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-staff-768x528.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/8bc0c580-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-staff-1024x704.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9974\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Megan Morello.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m trying to be a mentor tool to all my cooks. I\u0026#8217;m not just telling them what to do in the kitchen. I\u0026#8217;m trying to teach them that there\u0026#8217;s more to being a chef. You need to know how to manage money. You need to know how to cost your recipes. It\u0026#8217;s not all about creating something and putting it on a menu blindly. You have to have an idea of how much it costs you. How did you figure out that cost? How much are you going to sell it for? Where are you going to source from? I show them all the steps because then they know how much work it really does take. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m doing this stuff that\u0026#8217;s behind the scenes that they don\u0026#8217;t see, but is required so the ship runs smoothly. Because I\u0026#8217;m giving that extra effort, that\u0026#8217;s why they want to be here. They\u0026#8217;re getting more out of it than just learning about ingredients. They\u0026#8217;re learning about how to be a proper leader, how to take care of each other, and how to handle things as a team. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have three dishes coming on the menu created made by my line cooks—dishes we collaborated on. One thing Anthony Sinsay said, and I say the same thing, is that the three Cs —communication, collaboration, and consistency—make a successful kitchen. I breathe it down these guys\u0026#8217; necks that consistency is what gets people coming back. I use a reference to McDonald\u0026#8217;s. \u0026#8220;How many years have you guys been eating McDonald\u0026#8217;s? Since you were born you\u0026#8217;ve been eating freaking Chicken McNuggets. And why do you keep going back? Because it tastes the same, right?\u0026#8221; They\u0026#8217;re like, \u0026#8220;Yeah, it tastes the same.\u0026#8221; I\u0026#8217;m like, \u0026#8220;Because it\u0026#8217;s consistent. This is the reason McDonald’s has been around forever. Getting people through the door is one thing, but getting them to come back is the hard part.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9975\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9975\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/06/2425787f-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-looking-over-kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"932\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9975\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2425787f-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-looking-over-kitchen.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2425787f-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-looking-over-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2425787f-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-looking-over-kitchen-768x511.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2425787f-tara-monsod-animae-san-diego-looking-over-kitchen-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9975\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Megan Morello.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou build consistency with really good service. No matter what time you come here, you get great service. And the same thing with the kitchen. If you get a ragu now, when you come back tomorrow or next week or months from now, it\u0026#8217;s meant to be the exact same way no matter who actually made it. And collaborating is what\u0026#8217;s key. When I make something, I go around and I\u0026#8217;m like, \u0026#8220;Taste this, taste this. Does it taste good? What do you think? What do \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e think? And what do \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e think?\u0026#8221; It\u0026#8217;s not for my ego. I hate to say it, but what drives a lot of chefs is their ego. They\u0026#8217;re like, \u0026#8220;I made that. Nobody else made that. It\u0026#8217;s my idea.\u0026#8221; It might be my idea, but that doesn\u0026#8217;t mean it couldn\u0026#8217;t be better. It can be collaborative, like, \u0026#8220;\u0026#8221;Chef, I think it needs more acid.\u0026#8221; I think you\u0026#8217;re right! And then we taste it, and we\u0026#8217;re both like, \u0026#8220;Yeah!\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of my line cooks, Chianne Mallari, created this dish that\u0026#8217;s going on the menu today. It started as a pork sausage, then it ended up being the sausage inside of a dish with pork and clams. It’s almost a classic take on pork, clams, and pasta, but we\u0026#8217;re doing it with Korean rice cakes in a tamarind sauce with basil and mint. And the tamarind sauce has fish sauce and garlic in it, so it\u0026#8217;s got this sweet, salty, savory vibe going on. It\u0026#8217;s reminiscent of pasta, but not really pasta. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what Chianne’s going to do today is communicate to the prep team what exactly she wants, and how to make it. You also have to think about how you’re going to execute it on the line. Who\u0026#8217;s going to execute it? How are you going to streamline it so that every single time it’s consistent? This is what I\u0026#8217;m thinking about when they catch me spacing out, off in my corner over here. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen pre-shift comes, Chianne’s going to present it. Everything that I would do, she\u0026#8217;s going to do, because she needs to learn how to do it. I could do it for her, but it\u0026#8217;s better for her to do it because it\u0026#8217;s her dish.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told all the cooks, \u0026#8220;If you guys want to put stuff on the summer menu, start thinking now.\u0026#8221; I had one cook who was like, \u0026#8220;Chef, what do you want?\u0026#8221; I\u0026#8217;m like, \u0026#8220;What do you mean, what do I want? I want a dish.\u0026#8221; He\u0026#8217;s like, \u0026#8220;Well, what exactly do you want?\u0026#8221; So I said, \u0026#8220;That\u0026#8217;s up to you to think about it. That\u0026#8217;s why I\u0026#8217;m asking you guys.” It could start as one thing and evolve to something else, but it has to start with an idea. Let\u0026#8217;s work on your idea. If it\u0026#8217;s good, I\u0026#8217;ll put it on the menu.

The gorge–and by extension Fayetteville–are known for outdoor recreational sports such as mountain biking, rock climbing, and whitewater rafting.  \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m originally from southern West Virginia. My wife and I raised our son, Seth, in Morgantown, because we both went to WVU, and when he graduated high school, we decided to move back home to southern West Virginia and open up a brewery here in Fayetteville. It\u0026#8217;s a really beautiful area surrounded by a national park. So we came here in 2000, and we bought a building in 2017 in the city limits of Fayetteville. We renovated the space and started a small brewpub with the kitchen, and we catered to people that are coming here to enjoy the area. We opened up in April 2019 and had our first year—we had a little bit of success, not as much as we\u0026#8217;d like—then the pandemic happened. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pivoted and did some packaging and went that route to try to stay open, and we were able to survive. And now we\u0026#8217;re starting to have some success. This is our first season that\u0026#8217;s out of the pandemic, and we\u0026#8217;ve already started to see numbers that supersede what we\u0026#8217;ve seen in the past. In fact, this past week was our most successful week that we\u0026#8217;ve had to date. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m a mountain biker and a boater. The mountain biking here is world class. I\u0026#8217;ve biked in California, Colorado, New Mexico, and all over the East Coast. And by far, this is some of the best biking I\u0026#8217;ve ever done. I grew up mountain biking in this area. There\u0026#8217;s a lot of new trail development going on here, too. That\u0026#8217;s one of the big things that drew me to this area. Family, first and foremost, certainly. And then second, it was definitely the outdoor activities.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s even gotten bigger since I moved here. I probably know two dozen people, maybe three dozen people, that moved here just to rock climb. They bought houses and are working remotely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a long time coming. It was definitely a little hidden secret on the climbing front. I think people are like, \u0026#8220;Okay, I can live in either the Red River Gorge in Kentucky or the New River Gorge and be able to hit both spots and climb 365 days a year.\u0026#8221; And you can still get to Charlotte or DC in a half a day\u0026#8217;s drive. Up until about a year ago, housing was pretty affordable, and, comparatively speaking to the rest of the country, it\u0026#8217;s still very affordable. Now with the demand for housing, because you have a lot of remote workers moving here, the housing prices have climbed.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a kid, I grew up in the gorge, and back then you weren\u0026#8217;t allowed to mountain bike. We rode mountain bikes in the park, and the rangers were like, \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m going to take your bike if I see you here again.\u0026#8221; I knew people were going to recognize it for the world-class adventure it offers—whitewater rafting, climbing, mountain biking, and trail running. I thought it was going to happen like maybe 15 years ago, but it\u0026#8217;s just started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe definitely consider the fact that this is such an outdoor-focused town when we make our beer. We do a series called Wild and Free, and we highlight an endangered species that\u0026#8217;s indigenous to West Virginia. We have a beer called the Flying Squirrel, which is another species that was almost in danger because of the loss of \u003ca href=\"https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/sustaining_forests/conserve_enhance/biodiversity/red_spruce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003espruce forest trees\u003c/a\u003e. But the spruce forests are starting to come back. We actually use spruce tips in the Flying Squirrel. That\u0026#8217;s one of my favorite beers of all time because you get the pine flavor of the spruce tips. I love highlighting the flying squirrel. It\u0026#8217;s a beautiful animal, and the fact that it and the spruce forests are coming back strong is a win for West Virginia. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn our Green Salamander beer, we use local lavender and rosemary. So we use local ingredients in order to highlight that stuff, too. It makes a little funky beer that maybe people have never tried before—they\u0026#8217;ve never had a beer brewed with brut Champagne yeast that has lavender and rosemary. We have that flexibility because we are a small brewery.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCraft brewing has a weird dynamic being a manufacturing facility that has to have a septic tank. The stainless steel has to be bacteria free, and the whole process has to be very cognizant of bacteria. It\u0026#8217;s an industrial process, and it\u0026#8217;s pumps and tanks and measurements and science. I haven\u0026#8217;t practiced as a professional engineer, but everything from an engineering standpoint is being put to work in every facet of what we do. There is zero doubt that it\u0026#8217;s an engineering process on a daily basis.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the pandemic, we bought a property across the street, turned it into parking, and then turned our parking lot into outdoor space. We built a pavilion and put a stage up. We definitely had to pivot if we were going to survive because people did not want to be indoors. And the fact is when you\u0026#8217;re coming to Fayetteville, it\u0026#8217;s an outdoor town, and that\u0026#8217;s what people want. They want to have an outdoor experience, pandemic or not. I knew that over the short term an outdoor space was necessary, and over the long term it was going to work out because it\u0026#8217;s what people want anyway. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PPP and the other government assistance literally kept us afloat and allowed us to pivot. We had good numbers last summer, but this summer, we\u0026#8217;re going to be even better. Because of the new national park designation, we\u0026#8217;re seeing a lot of families. On top of that, we\u0026#8217;re seeing a demographic of older people who are park-bound. They might not be climbers, but they love the fact that they can get that stamp that says it\u0026#8217;s a national park. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe get a report every day on returning customers versus new customers. As of late, it\u0026#8217;s been about a 50-50 split between tourists and locals. There are the people that are from West Virginia, like myself, and then there are people that have moved here to climb and to bike or to be river guides. But both populations are very reluctant to frequent new places. We\u0026#8217;re just starting to get regulars now because they\u0026#8217;re like, \u0026#8220;They\u0026#8217;ve been open for three years, they made it through the pandemic. We can trust them now.\u0026#8221; That\u0026#8217;s just the way it is. It\u0026#8217;s the mentality of outdoor people and West Virginia folks that are maybe reluctant to open up to new ideas or just a new concept, I should say.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s kind of weird, because there\u0026#8217;s a lot of people that think, \u0026#8220;I moved here so I could climb and not be around a bunch of people.\u0026#8221; Some climbers are like, \u0026#8220;Aw, man. My spot\u0026#8217;s been found.\u0026#8221; And housing has been a big issue because a lot of people are turning their places into Airbnbs. People can\u0026#8217;t afford a house anymore. But I would say the majority are grateful to have the opportunity to show off West Virginia. Let\u0026#8217;s face it, West Virginia has had a stigma of being uneducated, uncultured, or maybe having an undesirable culture. The opposite is true. For me and my family, this is an opportunity to show off what we\u0026#8217;ve known all along, that West Virginia has culture, food, and beautiful places to visit. We have great traditions, and on top of that we\u0026#8217;re forming new traditions, like beer traditions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mix of native West Virginians and new folks have made this their home. It\u0026#8217;s a total embrace. Now the ramps are coming up, and there are restaurants that are integrating ramps into their recipes. We have an old-time jam on the third Sunday of every month. It\u0026#8217;s traditional Appalachian music, and people come and play guitars, banjos, mandolins, and fiddles. Appalachian culture is strong here in Fayetteville. Most folks honor the traditions that have been here for hundreds of years. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to give people a great experience here in Fayetteville and southern West Virginia. Our staff lets people know what\u0026#8217;s going on in the area. For people who maybe aren\u0026#8217;t craft beer drinkers, we educate them that this is a bridge between domestic beer and craft beer, and we make them feel at home and welcome. Sometimes tourist towns tend to be too cool or give off the air of \u0026#8220;We don\u0026#8217;t care. There\u0026#8217;s a whole other group coming in next week.\u0026#8221; I want to be the opposite. I want to be very hospitable and welcoming so people can go back and tell others that they had a great experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe just bought a brand new canning line, and we\u0026#8217;re able to package a lot more efficiently than we were. Our goal is to grow as a brewery. I love the brewpub model, and I love what we\u0026#8217;ve done with the taproom because I really do think it\u0026#8217;s the foundation for what Freefolk is. But I think we\u0026#8217;re achieving those goals through packaging and distribution. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe self-distribute up the I-79 corridor, up to Morgantown, to Charleston, Huntington, Lewisburg, and Beckley. That\u0026#8217;s our route right now. In the future, as we grow, we will probably take on distributors in the eastern panhandle and in the northern panhandle, which is Willie and Martinsburg. There is a population density issue for us, because there\u0026#8217;s not a lot of people in West Virginia. The largest city has 70,000 people. You have to distribute over a lot of land area, which is logistically tough. But it is very helpful that we can self-distribute.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinding personnel is a problem, too. Obviously, wintertime is really tough here. We are constantly trying to incentivize our kitchen staff, saying, \u0026#8220;Hey, it\u0026#8217;s a really long summer. We get it. It\u0026#8217;s really tough. And the winters are slow.\u0026#8221; We stay open 365 days a year because of that same reason. One thing I think will happen eventually is that more people will start coming here during the winter months because there\u0026#8217;s great hiking, biking, and climbing, but it\u0026#8217;s just going to take time. I think part of that is people like us need to stay open and provide. In the past, you’d have a couple of dozen businesses straight-up close in November and then open back up in April. That hurts tourism when people come here and nobody\u0026#8217;s open. But I think that\u0026#8217;s going to turn for us in the future. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne piece of advice I’d give to visitors is to stay a little bit longer, because a lot of folks are here for Friday and Saturday, and they\u0026#8217;re trying to fit in all this stuff. But there\u0026#8217;s so much to do outdoors and local places to hit. I would spend maybe three or four or five days here rather than just two.\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003eJeff Edwards is head brewer and a founder of Freefolk Brewery in Fayetteville, West Virginia.

href=\"https://birchandryesf.com/\"\u003eBirch \u0026#038; Rye\u003c/a\u003e, a modern Russian restaurant in San Francisco’s Noe Valley that opened in February 2022 against a backdrop of Russia invading Ukraine. El-Wattar cooked with her mother during her childhood in Moscow, foraging for mushrooms at their rural dacha. She moved with her family to the United States at the age of 18 to study Russian literature and philosophy at Columbia University before studying food as medicine at the Ayurvedic Institute in New Mexico, completing her formal training at New York\u0026#8217;s Natural Gourmet Institute. Birch \u0026#038; Rye is her first restaurant.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened two weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Nobody could have anticipated this. I certainly couldn\u0026#8217;t have. It was so humiliating for me to think of myself as being Russian after the San Francisco consulate was shut down in 2016 due to the Russian meddling in the U.S. election. When somebody asked me where I was from, I would pause before answering. You just never know how that person feels about you given the circumstances. This collective shame has been a theme of my immigration experience. Birch \u0026#038; Rye was originally conceived as a way to find pride in my culture. So it\u0026#8217;s all very ironic because two weeks after we opened, talk about a collective shame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeartbreaking doesn\u0026#8217;t even describe this experience. It\u0026#8217;s been absolutely soul-crushing. Ukraine and Russia are very close cultures, and we share a soul. I\u0026#8217;m being sincere. We have a lot of similarities in food, culture, language, and history. However painful and complicated it has been, the idea that Russians could invade Ukraine had been unthinkable to me. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took us a few weeks to even realize what was happening. We were so shaken that we didn\u0026#8217;t even know how to talk to our customers about it. We had meetings to discuss how we should talk to the public. We\u0026#8217;re here to represent Russian culture, but what do we say if somebody asks about what\u0026#8217;s happening? From day one, we took a very strong stance against the Russian government and the invasion of Ukraine. But do we have a right for any pride, or is it just shame? How do we show up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy great-grandparents were from Ukraine. Originally we were Jewish from Ukraine, and my great grandparents immigrated to Moscow. So I definitely have Ukrainian blood in me. I don\u0026#8217;t have any relatives left in Ukraine that I know of, but my sister has a lot of friends there. She happens to be a Ukrainian scholar who did her PhD in Ukrainian history in Odessa. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother and my father had to escape Russia because they opposed the war, and they didn\u0026#8217;t know if there would be a lockdown, and all the airports were shutting down. There were no flights to Western countries. They had to fly to Turkey and then to London. My brother has two tiny kids, and they just did not feel safe. Just overnight they left everything and got on the flight to Turkey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery day I have very touching and heartfelt encounters with diners that come in and share their stories. Some are direct stories, like their family members are in Ukraine. Some are much more nuanced, and so it has become a place of safety for people to come in and share how they feel about this war. And because it\u0026#8217;s been so emotional for me, many times they start crying, and I start crying with them tableside. At first I was so embarrassed, but I just couldn\u0026#8217;t help it. I have Ukrainians come in and say how grateful they are to have anything Russian that they can relate to. I have Russians come in telling me how heartbroken and responsible they feel, and asking me what they can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9933\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9933\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/05/dfae6a9b-anya-el-wattar-birch-and-rye-san-francisco-portrait.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9933\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/dfae6a9b-anya-el-wattar-birch-and-rye-san-francisco-portrait.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/dfae6a9b-anya-el-wattar-birch-and-rye-san-francisco-portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/dfae6a9b-anya-el-wattar-birch-and-rye-san-francisco-portrait-768x512.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/dfae6a9b-anya-el-wattar-birch-and-rye-san-francisco-portrait-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9933\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eChef-owner Anya El-Wattar at Birch \u0026#038; Rye restaurant in San Francisco. Photo: Erin Ng.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis human response is very healing for people. I didn\u0026#8217;t sign up for this at all. I was thinking my biggest challenge was how can I modernize the Russian menu. I had no idea I\u0026#8217;d be in this position of sometimes a psychologist, sometimes a priest, and sometimes an ambassador. I feel so honored, and I feel that this is such an important place for people to come in and heal a little bit and get a little bit of hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anyone is boycotting us, I don\u0026#8217;t know because we\u0026#8217;re busy. I have my own theory, but I think that because we stood up for Ukraine, that we stood up for what\u0026#8217;s right—maybe that\u0026#8217;s been our blessing. We stood up for democracy. We stood up for what I believe Russians should stand up for. We were so clear and articulate about our protest against those atrocities from the Russian government. We have had no negative feedback from our diners up to now. Customers come in and they see the sunflower—the national flower of Ukraine—blue and yellow ribbons around every vase, stickers on our front door and window, and every one of our cars. And what\u0026#8217;s most important is they feel our heart. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany Americans don\u0026#8217;t understand the level of interconnectedness that we have and what a particular kind of betrayal this is against Ukraine because we were so linked. I was very strong about educating the staff, both front of house and back of house, around empathy and really listening to people and really strongly standing for what we believe is right. Perhaps that has been our saving grace. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I see is the true loss for Russia in this war is that it\u0026#8217;s losing its soul. Only a soulless country can behave this way to another country. In order for me to have hope, I can only envision a kind of Russia that I am trying to embody here in this restaurant. One that is inclusive, nonviolent, open to dialogue, and pro-democracy. We have embodied those qualities in our kitchen culture from day one. When we started building the DNA of this restaurant, I wanted to have total inclusion, kindness, understanding, and the healthiest restaurant culture. I didn\u0026#8217;t know that I was preparing for something bigger, but it was important for me to lay this foundation for the restaurant because I knew I was overcoming a lot of prejudice against my culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recently organized a collaborative five-course dinner fundraiser for \u003ca href=\"https://stories.zagat.com/posts/world-central-kitchens-nate-mook-on-activating-local-food-relief\"\u003eWorld Central Kitchen\u003c/a\u003e and Ukraine with Dominique Crenn. I reached out to Dominique because I knew she had a big heart and really cares, and I knew it would be so meaningful to have her support. She\u0026#8217;s been such a good friend, and she has such a big influence in the community. My own sister came as a speaker, and she cried during her presentation. She moved to the German border and was helping her friends from Odessa to move through Poland and into Germany. She flew here from London to be at this event to support me. We raised $108,000 that evening, but I still think about what more I can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a drink on the cocktail menu, Olena\u0026#8217;s Flowers, named after the First Lady of Ukraine and made with linden flower and linden honey. A hundred percent of the proceeds goes to \u003ca href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/\"\u003eDoctors Without Borders\u003c/a\u003e. In July, I\u0026#8217;m working with a Ukrainian chef in San Francisco, Anna Voloshyna, to host another fundraiser dinner, serving a half-Ukrainian, half-Russian meal with pre-Soviet recipes. Anna told me that her dream is to have a long table along the Russian-Ukrainian border, but we can do this at Birch \u0026#038; Rye and create a symbol for that. We\u0026#8217;re trying to embody and emanate the kind of qualities that we want Russia to exhibit.\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003eAnya El-Wattar is chef-owner of Birch \u0026#038; Rye, a modern Russian restaurant in San Francisco’s Noe Valley that opened in February 2022 against a backdrop of Russia invading Ukraine.

The son of Haitian immigrants, Viaud worked in several restaurants in and around New England, gaining enough notice to be selected as a \u003c/em\u003eTop Chef\u003cem\u003e contestant and James Beard Award semifinalist. After becoming more outspoken about Black Lives Matter in the wake of George Floyd\u0026#8217;s murder, Viaud noticed an uptick in \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CcXJQphuC4t/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\"\u003enegative and racist reactions\u003c/a\u003e—which only firmed up his resolve to speak out and speak up sincerely, and with the hope of actually engaging in conversation and communication.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the George Floyd protests, I put stickers on my restaurant\u0026#8217;s front door standing in solidarity with Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ pride. Since I put those on the door, I\u0026#8217;ve been getting a lot of backlash from some people around the community who think otherwise, posting nasty comments on social media or saying nasty remarks to my staff. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;ve gotten emails from people saying that they\u0026#8217;re no longer supporting the restaurant. There was an incident a couple of weeks ago where somebody within the community put two stickers over my stickers. One of them was a Proud Boys sticker. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most recent incident was when a guest came in, sat at the bar, was frustrated that he had to order off a QR code menu, and immediately stood up. As he was leaving, he announced to the staff that had been waiting on him that he didn\u0026#8217;t support the Black Lives Matter movement anyway. I know that there\u0026#8217;s some support throughout the community for everything I stand for. But these moments do take me by surprise, and it truly does hurt. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo at the end of the night, when that last incident took place, I gathered the whole staff and I said, \u0026#8220;Listen, guys. I appreciate you standing up for me and everything, but I really want to be at the forefront of interacting with these guests who have these issues.” It\u0026#8217;s not so much that I want to berate them for their actions or anything. I just want to have a face-to-face conversation and see what it is that they don\u0026#8217;t understand about this particular movement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that the Black Lives Matter movement started with such a great cause, and then through the riots and everything, it completely transformed. But the movement itself still sheds light and raises awareness that Black people are mistreated in this country. We are using our voices to make sure that our stories get told, and educate those around us who might not have the same understanding that we do, to see things through our eyes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I have been brought up in the right kitchen environments where racist banter wasn\u0026#8217;t allowed. But there\u0026#8217;s definitely been times where people come up to me and say \u0026#8220;you act white\u0026#8221; or something like that, just because of the way that I was brought up. They perceived Black people to act in a certain type of way. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, I had a previous business partner, and we were 50-50 partners until I completely took over in 2020. Even now, people see me in the restaurant and don\u0026#8217;t view me as the owner. Only those who have seen me on \u003cem\u003eTop Chef\u003c/em\u003e or the James Beard awards or things like that know who I am, and know that I own the business. Even regular customers who really know nothing about Greenleaf, they would come in and sometimes look at my general manager and think that\u0026#8217;s the owner, or my front-of-house manager and think they\u0026#8217;re the owner, or talk to the bartender and think they\u0026#8217;re the owner—all when I\u0026#8217;m standing right behind them in the kitchen, and they can see me, too. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt definitely hurts that they wouldn\u0026#8217;t consider a Black man could own a business such as this, and be as successful as I have been over the past three years. But the staff, they\u0026#8217;re very open about it and tell them, \u0026#8220;No, that\u0026#8217;s actually the chef right there. He owns the business.\u0026#8221; They\u0026#8217;re super supportive of everything that I stand for. This whole industry—we see it day in and day out—is a white-male-dominated industry. So it’s great to have like-minded individuals stand behind me and raise awareness to the fact that the guests might have this misconception that everything in the state is owned by a white male.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9913\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9913\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/05/1e4b926e-chris-viaud-greenlead-milford-new-hampshire-portrait.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9913\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1e4b926e-chris-viaud-greenlead-milford-new-hampshire-portrait.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1e4b926e-chris-viaud-greenlead-milford-new-hampshire-portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1e4b926e-chris-viaud-greenlead-milford-new-hampshire-portrait-768x512.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1e4b926e-chris-viaud-greenlead-milford-new-hampshire-portrait-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9913\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eChef-owner Chris Viaud at Greenleaf restaurant in Milford, New Hampshire. Photo: Jenn Bakos.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen everything happened with the George Floyd protests in the beginning, there was a gathering that took place right in the center of town, at the Oval. I asked all the staff if they would feel comfortable joining me, and the majority of them did. So we marched around, and I explained to them how this makes me feel, and what kind of things that we\u0026#8217;re going through as we start to now have the opportunity to open up and express what we\u0026#8217;ve gone through in the past, and how that changes our future and predicts our narrative. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I ask the staff to ensure that I’m at the forefront of the situation when guests say hurtful things, that\u0026#8217;s me saying, \u0026#8220;I want these guests to feel just as comfortable telling you, as a white male or female, as they would be saying these things to my face.\u0026#8221; Because oftentimes everybody is just hiding behind the keyboard, making these remarks on social media. But you don\u0026#8217;t know if when you\u0026#8217;re standing right in front of them that they will say those same hurtful words, knowing that they\u0026#8217;re speaking to a human being. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#8217;t think it\u0026#8217;s ever a tense situation—it\u0026#8217;s more having an open conversation and letting them know that I am human, just like them. We share the same dreams, goals, and aspirations, and I deserve to speak my piece, and have my voice, and have that respected just as well as they do. It\u0026#8217;s giving them an understanding of where I\u0026#8217;ve come from, where we as a people have come from, and the struggles that we continue to face. And maybe enlighten them that we\u0026#8217;re not as privileged as they might think. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;ve never had the opportunity to have a face-to-face like this, but every time an incident happens over social media or email, I draft an email and send it back to them in hopes that there would be a response. It\u0026#8217;s just me opening up and saying, \u0026#8220;I hear what you\u0026#8217;re saying, but here\u0026#8217;s my point of view, and here\u0026#8217;s why I stand for what I stand for.\u0026#8221; But I\u0026#8217;ve never gotten any response back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think they\u0026#8217;re often just expressing their opinions and views without wanting to open up a dialogue or wanting to understand. Because those who really want to learn more about the struggles we face, they would engage, they would respond back and say, \u0026#8220;Sorry, I didn\u0026#8217;t know you were going through all of this.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is always that notion that the guest is always right. And yes, to a certain extent, we do have to treat all our guests fairly and hear what they have to say. But at the same time, the guests can\u0026#8217;t take advantage of that to get what they want at all times. There are often times when the guest is wrong, but the restaurants or the service staff bites their tongue or holds back because they don\u0026#8217;t want to offend the guests, or they want the repeat customers. But guests need to understand that they\u0026#8217;re not always right, and it\u0026#8217;s okay for us to work together and explain the reasons why they\u0026#8217;re wrong, or explain what happened and our thought process. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen all this first started taking place, I never wanted to be the voice of anything. I just wanted to say, \u0026#8220;This is where I stand,\u0026#8221; and that\u0026#8217;s it. But then it turned more into people viewing me as an activist. I\u0026#8217;ve definitely become more open and vocal about expressing my thoughts, and getting my staff to understand why I say certain things. After all, they\u0026#8217;re dealing with the guests that are coming in and saying these things. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s important because I have members of the LGBTQ community on my staff. I have people of color on my staff. I want to make sure they know they are welcome here—that they feel protected and safe. I will defend them any chance I get. I want them to see that the opportunities I\u0026#8217;ve had to come up in this industry as a Black male—that they can do something like that too. They can be like me. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s what I aspired to when I was coming up in the industry, just looking at chefs like \u003ca href=\"https://stories.zagat.com/posts/marcus-samuelsson-on-showing-up-for-the-black-community\"\u003eMarcus Samuelsson\u003c/a\u003e, who made a huge impact. I was always wondering why there were no other Black chefs taking the stand, and why there was no representation for our community. So for me to be vocal about these things hopefully helps the future generations see that there are people of color that look like them and can do these amazing things. We will continue to defend their names, their background, their heritage, their identity, and continue to push the narrative forward where we deserve to be treated equally. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople are becoming more open-minded and willing to listen. A lot more people within these communities want to support Black-owned businesses. Those people far outweigh any of the negative remarks I\u0026#8217;ve ever received, and I\u0026#8217;m thrilled to have that support. But some people say, \u0026#8220;Politics shouldn\u0026#8217;t be discussed in this kind of setting,\u0026#8221; like in hospitality. But when it comes to Black Lives Matter, we\u0026#8217;re not talking about politics here. These are human lives we\u0026#8217;re dealing with. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Greenleaf, I always say, is a safe space open for conversation. Maybe not during public dining, but there\u0026#8217;s always that opportunity where you can reach out through email or contact me by phone. We can discuss, have a conversation, sit down and chat, and go over what the future of the hospitality industry will be like. Hospitality encompasses so much more than just providing service. It\u0026#8217;s sharing a story, sharing experiences, and learning about the people you\u0026#8217;re spending time with.\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003eChris Viaud is chef-owner of Greenleaf and Ansanm restaurants in Milford, New Hampshire.

I was pregnant with Cassidy, and my husband and I knew that if we were going to be at a rafting company, you would find yourself—especially back then, because cell phones and social media definitely weren’t a thing—a little disconnected. We decided that if our kids were going to school here and being raised here, we wanted to be more connected to the community. My husband had been doing menus for the previous owner of the cafe, and she needed somebody to work for her, and so I did. Within a couple of weeks she suggested, \u0026#8220;You should just buy this place.\u0026#8221; And I thought, \u0026#8220;Okay, how hard could that be?\u0026#8221; Talk about a learning curve. And then 22 years later, here we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCASSIDY BAYES:\u003c/strong\u003e I took over running Cathedral about a year ago. It was last April. I still wait tables and everything. Right now we\u0026#8217;re trying to hire a bunch of people to get in here for the summertime because it\u0026#8217;s our busiest season, during rafting and climbing season and everything like that. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWENDY:\u003c/strong\u003e I only come into the cafe probably a few days a week. I try to help with the gift shop and put orders away. I still order for the cafe to keep connected, and it keeps me connected to Cassidy as well. But most of my day is spent starting a real estate company, and I have two new agents, so we\u0026#8217;re training them. I still feel connected to the cafe, and I still miss sitting in here and talking to everyone, which was my favorite part, of course. So I come in on the weekends to do that.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t have any previous hospitality experience, other than what you have as common knowledge and general decency. I didn’t have any training. I had never waited tables before. Then that turned into 16-hour days here. And then Cassidy took over and allowed me to move on. I tend to do the same thing over and over. You know, you tend to get into a rut, and I like to do different things all the time. This allowed me to go explore other things.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCASSIDY:\u003c/strong\u003e I grew up at the cafe. There’s pictures of me in photo albums literally holding on to my mom’s back pockets and following her to tables and checking people out at the register—they bought this place when I was four. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWENDY:\u003c/strong\u003e You were four and a half. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCASSIDY:\u003c/strong\u003e Everyone\u0026#8217;s watched me grow up here.

Then I made my way up to waiting tables, and I was one of the main waitresses here. I went to WVU after I graduated high school and got a degree in integrated communications, then I came back and we opened up a juice bar that we no longer have after the pandemic. We also opened up another business right after I graduated called \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SouthsideJunctionTapHouse/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSouthside Junction Tap House\u003c/a\u003e, and that\u0026#8217;s in downtown Fayetteville, too. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9876\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9876\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/05/da63cbd1-cathedral-cafe-7.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"936\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9876\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/da63cbd1-cathedral-cafe-7.jpeg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/da63cbd1-cathedral-cafe-7-300x201.jpeg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/da63cbd1-cathedral-cafe-7-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/da63cbd1-cathedral-cafe-7-1024x685.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9876\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eWendy and Cassidy Bayes at Cathedral Cafe in Fayetteville, West Virginia.

The locals I know—they are the same people that come in here to get a black coffee every single day before going to their job. But a lot of them are raft guys that come here each season, or climbers that have been coming in to get their same breakfast for the past 20 years. They just remember seeing me every season. When they find out I\u0026#8217;m Wendy\u0026#8217;s daughter, they are like, holy crap!  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I was running the taphouse, and just this past year I took over running the cafe when mom was transferring over to doing real estate full time. Especially with the national park designation, she was getting a lot more people coming here looking for houses. I just wanted to make sure that we were still breathing that fresh life into the place that everyone grew up to love. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I went to college, I had an idea of what I wanted to do—run social media accounts for larger corporations. I really do enjoy doing marketing for businesses. But when I was graduating, I had a lot of friends that were coming back here. I really grew to love Fayetteville, and I wanted to be able to give back to the town that raised me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWENDY:\u003c/strong\u003e I tried my best to steer her away from it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCASSIDY:\u003c/strong\u003e My mom was like, \u0026#8220;You do not want to run a restaurant. Small businesses are hard.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWENDY:\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0026#8217;s a lot of work, and you give up a lot. I felt like, as a kid, that she gave up a lot, but she and my son told me, \u0026#8220;Mom, we didn\u0026#8217;t give up anything. We had a great childhood. We loved coming in here and being with everybody.\u0026#8221; So what I thought were sacrifices were actually memories that they cherished. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think us being a family with kids brought in everybody that had kids. People would stop on their way home—heck, kids stop on their way home from school and grab something. Their parents will give them $5, and if they don\u0026#8217;t have enough money, we charge them the $5 and just give it to them. Initially, we were isolated in our river company—and we\u0026#8217;re still best friends with all of those people—but the locals didn\u0026#8217;t know us from Adam. They\u0026#8217;d slowly come in, and now those are the people that come in every single Saturday. They warmed up to us and accepted us.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCASSIDY:\u003c/strong\u003e My mom was a mom before she was a mom. She was always meant to be a mom and take care of people. I love that about her, but people would run her over sometimes. She would give you the shirt right off her back. When you\u0026#8217;re running a small business, you\u0026#8217;ve got to be a little mean sometimes. I learned to be a little more stern. You can\u0026#8217;t always hire your friends. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWENDY:\u003c/strong\u003e You’re much better at setting boundaries. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCASSIDY:\u003c/strong\u003e She was in here every day, and I watched her work and stress herself out about certain things. I\u0026#8217;m just like, \u0026#8220;If it doesn\u0026#8217;t work out, it doesn\u0026#8217;t work out. If we don\u0026#8217;t get that done today, it will get done another day.\u0026#8221; I try to make sure that I still have time to be 26 and run a business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, with the national park designation and even a little bit before that, we started seeing new faces. We are so busy right now. Last year was the busiest year that we\u0026#8217;ve had in 21 years. We started seeing more people coming here for vacations. We\u0026#8217;re definitely becoming less of a local congregation spot, even though we still are open during the wintertime. But during our season, we see a lot of tourists. They come in and talk to us about their adventures and what they did that day on the whitewater, which is super cool. But it\u0026#8217;s a different vibe now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recently read an article—I don\u0026#8217;t remember what paper it was in—but we usually had 600,000 people coming to the gorge each season and going down the river or going rock climbing or whatever they were doing here. Last year it bumped up to \u003ca href=\"https://wset.com/news/local/new-river-gorge-had-record-visitation-in-2021\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e1.7 million\u003c/a\u003e. I was like, \u0026#8220;That makes so much sense.\u0026#8221; We\u0026#8217;ve had a line out the door. We used to do full table service, but now we switched to fast-casual dining where people come up to the bar to order and we carry out their food to their table, just because of the amount of people we\u0026#8217;re seeing. So many people have changed to doing it that way, and having outdoor dining, and creating more spaces for people to be able to be here with us. There\u0026#8217;s so many more Airbnbs and cabins, and all these rentals are opening up just because the demand is so much higher.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some people that moved to Fayetteville for that small-town charm. We do still have that, but with just more people. We\u0026#8217;re trying to keep it that way. But yeah, there\u0026#8217;s definitely some people that prefer having those dead winters and not as populated summers. But as a 26 year old, having this many people coming to a town that I\u0026#8217;ve loved my entire life is really cool. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9877\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9877\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/05/00948349-cathedral-cafe-4.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9877\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/00948349-cathedral-cafe-4.jpeg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/00948349-cathedral-cafe-4-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/00948349-cathedral-cafe-4-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/00948349-cathedral-cafe-4-1024x768.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9877\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Courtesy Cassidy Bayes.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWENDY:\u003c/strong\u003e During lockdown, we stayed open the entire time. We did to-go orders, but what we mostly did were family-style takeout meals because the population is growing a ton. We wanted to be able to offer something to the healthcare workers that were working these long shifts. They\u0026#8217;re still exhausted. They haven\u0026#8217;t got a break yet. We would have it hot and ready for them to take home when they stopped by. We also turned into a general store because nobody could find toilet paper, nobody could find yeast, flour, eggs. We had all this at our store, which was in the cafe. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you couldn\u0026#8217;t come in and dine anymore, but you could come in and pick up your order. Because everybody was so isolated, we would have locals come in and sit down on opposite corners of the restaurant. Our catering manager Jenny and I worked 10 hours a day, seven days a week, and we would sit in opposite corners of the restaurant, and they would just sit and talk to us for hours. They missed that \u0026#8220;cafe connection.” Then we\u0026#8217;d had people come in that were from out of town, just place a to-go order. Everybody felt that southern West Virginia was a safe place to go, so we took them in as well. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat led into real estate. We have a place right across the street from us, Michael Williams\u0026#8217; \u003ca href=\"https://bridgeboundcampers.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBridge Bound Campers\u003c/a\u003e, and he retrofits these brand new Ford vans and makes them into camper vans for everybody so that they can travel around and work remotely.

People do really love coming into the cafe when it\u0026#8217;s slow, and being able to sit at the bar and enjoy a cup of coffee while talking to our barista. Keeping them happy while also being able to facilitate the needs of all of the people that are traveling to the area is a fine line that you have to walk. You need to make sure that you don\u0026#8217;t lose the people that are the backbone of what you started. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen people come in and we know them, we shout their name from across the restaurant, even when it\u0026#8217;s full. It\u0026#8217;s the \u003cem\u003eCheers\u003c/em\u003e factor. I say, \u0026#8220;Hey, Jim,\u0026#8221; save a seat for him at the bar, and I save the crossword for him because I know he likes it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWENDY:\u003c/strong\u003e We still are the cafe family. And those same people, those same locals that we know and love, if we\u0026#8217;re busy, they will get up and clear tables. They would go in the back and wash dishes. They are down for whatever we need from them, so we try to go out of our way for them as well. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9878\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9878\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/05/1369febd-cathedral-cafe-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1033\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9878\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1369febd-cathedral-cafe-3.jpeg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1369febd-cathedral-cafe-3-300x221.jpeg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1369febd-cathedral-cafe-3-768x567.jpeg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1369febd-cathedral-cafe-3-1024x756.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9878\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Courtesy Cassidy Bayes.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCASSIDY:\u003c/strong\u003e Right now we\u0026#8217;re just trying to wrap our arms around the amount of people that we\u0026#8217;re seeing, dealing with food costs going up, and trying to stay fully staffed.

Once I got down here, the abundance of fresh local seafood, oysters, and produce was a deciding factor on me staying. There\u0026#8217;s a great restaurant scene—a lot of cool chefs and a lot of restaurants doing interesting stuff I was able to be a part of.

The beach out here is a little bit more pristine. The houses aren’t right on the beach. They actually have a moratorium on new restaurants on the island—you can only put a restaurant in a building that was once a restaurant, so there\u0026#8217;s a limited supply. But I always come out here to go to the beach and to \u003ca href=\"https://www.poestavern.com/\"\u003ePoe\u0026#8217;s Tavern\u003c/a\u003e, a burger place across the street. When I opened up Obstinate Daughter, it was going to be one of the first nicer restaurants out here. I jumped at the chance to be out here on the island. It\u0026#8217;s a nice drive every day, and you\u0026#8217;re close to the beach. A lot of good tourist action during the summer, and then lots of locals during the off season. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharleston\u0026#8217;s definitely known for its seafood.

I had a friend run into the owner, Clint Gaskins, and he said, \u0026#8220;Hey, I think I might know someone you\u0026#8217;ll want to chat with.\u0026#8221; Clint then shot me a text and was like, \u0026#8220;Come down to the islands for a week.\u0026#8221; And I was like, \u0026#8220;Sure, that sounds wonderful.\u0026#8221; And we checked it a little bit, and then did an initial interview. I went down to St. Thomas and St. John for about a week, and then they offered me the business from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Longboard has two sister restaurants in the Virgin Islands. We have a Longboard on St. John. It\u0026#8217;s a smaller spot—they sort of focus on pokes, tacos, small plates, things like that. It\u0026#8217;s very close to Cruz Bay where a lot of the tourists come through. It\u0026#8217;s a little more casual. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other sister restaurant is on St. Thomas, the Easterly, and it\u0026#8217;s a lot more upscale. Coursed-out dinners, a wood-fire grill. They do these large steaks, these big grilled lobsters, grilled whole fish. When we opened up the Longboard here on Sullivan\u0026#8217;s, the goal was to fuse those two concepts. So we have the same kitchen as the Easterly with a wood-fired grill, a big open-flame oven, a big 12-top range, and all the equipment you could possibly need. We took all those grill influences from the Easterly and some of that lighter, fresh, tropical vibe from the Longboard and put them together. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9853\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9853\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/05/55ff887a-the-longboard-bar.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9853\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/55ff887a-the-longboard-bar.jpeg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/55ff887a-the-longboard-bar-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/55ff887a-the-longboard-bar-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/55ff887a-the-longboard-bar-1024x682.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9853\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Sarah Swan.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went down to the Virgin Islands every other week for about four months, so I was there quite a lot. I spent a lot of time in the kitchens, learning what they do and some of their systems as far as management and ordering goes. I also filled some gaps whenever their chef or a line cook was out of town. Then we did a lot of menu research and development. I worked with their recipes first to see what they were working with, and I worked with the products. I took over the specials when I was down there so I could get my feet wet using certain ingredients. We did some trips around the island, a lot of eating and researching, then some photo shoots to conceptualize the food itself. That\u0026#8217;s how I spent all my time—just immersing myself in the area over the course of four months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had to reverse-engineer the menu just a little bit. We would start with a dish, whether it be a Lowcountry dish or some other dish, and then add that Caribbean flavor to it. We had to tailor items to fit the space. For example, we do this great green curry mussel toast. You\u0026#8217;ll see curries pop up over there quite a lot. It could have been a French mussel dish, which is what we started with, but we added our own move to it. We were eating lunch next door at \u003ca href=\"https://hometeambbq.com/location/sullivans-island/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHome Team BBQ\u003c/a\u003e one day, and we were eating a marinated cucumber and tomato salad that you see here in the South all the time. We thought, what if it was a cucumber and mango salad with red onions and herbs and that same kind of flavor profile?  We start with dishes that we know and think that people would enjoy, then add that little extra thing that ties it back into the menu and the islands. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9854\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9854\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/05/6cab8dd0-toast.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9854\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6cab8dd0-toast.jpeg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6cab8dd0-toast-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6cab8dd0-toast-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6cab8dd0-toast-1024x682.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9854\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Sarah Swan.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharleston and the US Virgin Islands are trafficked a lot by boat, which influences which ingredients are available. We noticed on our trips that a lot of the food they eat on the islands is workingman\u0026#8217;s food—rice and beans, braised and stewed meats, and big, bold flavors. They use a ton of pork. The vegetables are cooked pretty strong. It has parallels to what you would get with any kind of old-school Charleston cooking. We make grits here, they make cornmeal porridge. There\u0026#8217;s definitely a lot of similarities. They have a greater plethora of tropical fruits and things that they grow in that area, but generally speaking, a lot of the techniques are really similar. We went to a place that was doing salt cod empanadas with yellow curry in them. And it\u0026#8217;s the same thing in Charleston, with, say, Country Captain, a dish that features curry as well. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, I was expecting the local food on the islands to be a little bit different. I wasn\u0026#8217;t expecting it to be these workingman\u0026#8217;s braises. I was expecting everything to be a lot lighter. And they do utilize a lot of ceviches and things that have come from the surrounding islands. I was really surprised at how much of a melting pot it was of different stuff. We were surprised when we started eating at these local spots how similar they were to Lowcountry cuisine. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9855\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9855\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/05/a9c3ca15-oyster.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9855\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a9c3ca15-oyster.jpeg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a9c3ca15-oyster-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a9c3ca15-oyster-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a9c3ca15-oyster-1024x682.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9855\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Sarah Swan.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowcountry cuisine is based on what grows in the area here in South Carolina. Lots of rice, beans, corn, tomatoes, peppers, and things that grow really well here. The Lowcountry has a lot of land, so you\u0026#8217;ll get a lot of different proteins, whereas on the islands they actually have a lot less land for proteins and big crops. So a ton of pork, lots of slow braises, very veggie centric. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur menu is a fusion of the two. A lot of stuff that you might not think goes together ends up going together pretty well. We have a strawberry and avocado salad right now. The strawberries are local, but the avocados are not. They use a ton of avocados down there in the islands. They\u0026#8217;re much closer to the source. We just incorporate that in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#8217;s a lot of shortages going on across the industry. Things will just sort of disappear—things that you wouldn\u0026#8217;t think are normal. There were months when we couldn\u0026#8217;t get cream cheese. We were ordering halved pecans the other week, and the vendors were like, \u0026#8220;Nope, all we have are these little tiny pieces of pecans.\u0026#8221; I called different purveyors and none of them had it. Price increases are definitely a big thing right now. Lots of purveyors are tacking on extra delivery fees and gas fees, so you have to find a way to navigate around that, whether it\u0026#8217;s a different meat or a different protein or a different purveyor or someone who\u0026#8217;s closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome solutions involve going to Costco. Most purveyors like you to stick with them, but we\u0026#8217;ve had to branch out and go searching for ingredients and things that people can\u0026#8217;t find. Sometimes you can find what you need on Amazon, whether it\u0026#8217;s yuzu paste or yuzu juice or something kind of random. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9856\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9856\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/05/1d9c8606-food.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9856\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1d9c8606-food.jpeg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1d9c8606-food-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1d9c8606-food-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1d9c8606-food-1024x682.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9856\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Sarah Swan.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the whole, it\u0026#8217;s a new restaurant on Sullivan’s Island. If we look at our analytics, we get a ton of walk-in traffic, but we do have a good customer base that\u0026#8217;s eaten in our restaurants in the Virgin Islands. The Virgin Islands—this was unknown to me before I started with a company—are a pretty popular place to go on vacation, especially since you don\u0026#8217;t need a passport. It\u0026#8217;s pretty easy to get there, a four-hour flight. There\u0026#8217;s a lot of people who come in and are like, \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m so excited to try this place because I ate at the one in the Virgin Islands.\u0026#8221; There\u0026#8217;s not a ton of restaurants on those islands, especially St. John. If they\u0026#8217;re in that area, they would probably end up stopping at our spot at least once. But there are definitely a lot of new people who had no idea. I think the name kind of speaks for it. We\u0026#8217;re on the beach, we\u0026#8217;re on Sullivan\u0026#8217;s Island, we\u0026#8217;re called the Longboard. It gives you a little bit of an idea of what you\u0026#8217;re in for. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of the reason I\u0026#8217;ve stayed on the island is because you get a pretty set customer base. There\u0026#8217;s not as much competition around. It seems like whenever something closes for good, something better pops up in its space. So yeah, the moratorium absolutely works in our favor. There\u0026#8217;s only so much out here. We love that about Sullivan\u0026#8217;s Island. We hope that they don\u0026#8217;t allow more restaurants. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe restaurant that I was the chef de cuisine at for seven years is right down the street, so I still stay in touch with them. They pop over and borrow things every now and again. Two people that I used to work with at the Obstinate Daughter, they just opened up a restaurant called \u003ca href=\"https://www.sullivansfishcamp.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSullivan\u0026#8217;s Fish Camp\u003c/a\u003e right down the street. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_9857\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9857\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/05/aefab35c-spread.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"922\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9857\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/aefab35c-spread.jpeg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/aefab35c-spread-300x198.jpeg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/aefab35c-spread-768x506.jpeg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/aefab35c-spread-1024x674.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9857\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Sarah Swan.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as competition goes, the concepts that are out here are all fairly different. We have a barbecue place. We\u0026#8217;ve got Poe\u0026#8217;s, which is a burger place, and the Obstinate Daughter is pastas and pizza. And then we do this Caribbean small-plate-forward menu. Nothing\u0026#8217;s really the same. Before we head to work, sometimes we pop down to the co-op and grab a sandwich, or after we get off of work we head up the street to \u003ca href=\"https://mex1coastalcantina.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMex 1\u003c/a\u003e and hang out there. Or if you\u0026#8217;re in the middle of the day, you pop over to \u003ca href=\"https://hometeambbq.com/location/sullivans-island/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHome Team\u003c/a\u003e and have lunch and chat. So all of these people hang out in each other\u0026#8217;s restaurants and bars. It definitely has a good vibe to it. We\u0026#8217;ve got a lot of friends on the island. There\u0026#8217;s a text thread between all the restaurant owners on the island as well. It\u0026#8217;s definitely its own little community of people that work out here.\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003eWill Fincher is executive chef of The Longboard on Sullivan’s Island, South Carolina.

Now you\u0026#8217;re going to start working at the gas station.\u0026#8221; My dad had a gas station at Flatbush Avenue and Dean Street. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack then, in the early 90s, we were the only Asian people in the area. We dealt with a lot of racism, but also a lot of elbow grease, stocking shelves, sweeping the yards, stocking tires, cleaning bathrooms—you name it. In the summer, I worked five days or six days a week. We closed on Sundays, otherwise I\u0026#8217;m sure my dad would have made me work seven days. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was the richest kid in the school because I\u0026#8217;d get paid a $20 a day, which, if you think about it now, is child labor. But I guess it doesn\u0026#8217;t count when it\u0026#8217;s within your own family. Anyway, the point I\u0026#8217;m making is that typically every day he\u0026#8217;d order Chinese food—chicken with broccoli, beef with broccoli, General Tsao\u0026#8217;s chicken, egg foo young. But once in a blue moon, he would order sandwiches from the local bodega, and it was such a treat. They were big heroes, lots of mayo, lettuce, tomato. It was always pastrami and cheese or ham and cheese. Those are the only two sandwiches my dad knew. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut my mind was blown by sandwiches at 13 years old. I remember telling my dad—and I don\u0026#8217;t know what possessed me to say this—\u0026#8221;I can make a sandwich like this.\u0026#8221; He just stopped and looked at me and was like, \u0026#8220;Really? Okay.\u0026#8221; And then a week later, to my mom\u0026#8217;s dismay, there was a fucking professional meat slicer on the counter. My dad instructed my mom, like, \u0026#8220;Take Brian to Restaurant Depot and have him make lunch for the staff.\u0026#8221; He said to me, \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;ll pay you an extra $20.\u0026#8221; So that meant that I was making $40 a day. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_10031\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10031\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/06/b6177263-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-portrait.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10031\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/b6177263-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-portrait.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/b6177263-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/b6177263-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-portrait-768x512.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/b6177263-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-portrait-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10031\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eChef-owner Brian Tsao at Mission Sandwich Social in New York. Photo: Emily Schindler.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made basically the same thing the bodega was making—ham and cheese and pastrami and cheese. I thought I was getting fancy by putting peppers in there, or pickles or raw onions. The staff absolutely loved it. That was really my first memory of cooking food for money. I don\u0026#8217;t know, it just felt right. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYears later, in November 2019, I was visiting a friend in San Francisco. Just a trip, just hanging out. I love going to California at least once a year. I was in the Bay Area and met up with a buddy for lunch. No intentions. He\u0026#8217;s just a buddy of mine that I\u0026#8217;ve known through the metal scene. He took me to a spot called \u003ca href=\"http://www.littlelucca.com/\"\u003eLittle Lucca\u003c/a\u003e, and I saw them making sandwiches out of this crazy-looking bread. There were just tons of different combinations that were so fun and creative. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could clearly see this is a super DIY place because all the specials were in plastic sheets taped on the window and in very different degrees of yellow, depending on when they were posted up. But they were just so much fun, and this bread had this very distinctive pattern. I tried the sandwich, and my mind was blown. All of a sudden, I thought to myself, \u0026#8220;How come New York doesn\u0026#8217;t have this style of sandwich? How come I\u0026#8217;d never heard of or seen this bread before in my life,” which is called Dutch crunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I insisted that we try a number of sandwiches the next day. My weeklong trip became this sandwich search. I was so enthralled by this bread and this style of sandwich that’s stacked and saucey and veg-heavy and creative and fun. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_10032\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10032\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/06/3b25cec1-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-slicing-bread.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10032\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/3b25cec1-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-slicing-bread.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/3b25cec1-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-slicing-bread-300x200.jpg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/3b25cec1-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-slicing-bread-768x512.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/3b25cec1-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-slicing-bread-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10032\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Emily Schindler.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy background is in Asian cuisine. I grew up with a Korean mother and a Chinese father, so I grew up with these two cuisine types that are obviously very famous and very notable. But I always wanted to spread my wings with cuisine outside of Asia. I saw the sandwich as the perfect vessel to basically do whatever the fuck I want. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back to New York, and I couldn\u0026#8217;t stop thinking about these amazing sandwiches. And then I started to realize that New York sandwich culture is predominantly bodegas and \u003ca href=\"https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/katzs-deli\"\u003eKatz’s\u003c/a\u003e, both of which are absolutely amazing. Nothing wrong with these two sandwich cultures. But I felt there wasn\u0026#8217;t that much in between. I saw this opportunity, to do something different with something that can be easily understood. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere I am, getting inspired, thinking, \u0026#8220;The world is my oyster. I have all the time in the world to work on this project.\u0026#8221; I made another trip in December and another trip in January, and we all know what happened in March 2020. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hit pause on everything. I\u0026#8217;ve been cooking professionally for 18 years now. I also probably have undiagnosed ADHD. So come March, everything shuts down. Obviously like everyone else, I\u0026#8217;m completely devastated. But then I said to myself, \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m stuck at home. This is the first time I\u0026#8217;ve had all this time.\u0026#8221; And I kept telling myself that I wanted to do something on YouTube. I wanted to work more on my social media. I told myself, \u0026#8220;By the end of this pandemic, whenever it is, I\u0026#8217;m either going to have six-pack abs, or I\u0026#8217;m going to have a new skill.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_10033\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10033\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/06/9b33450a-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-building-sandwich.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10033\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/9b33450a-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-building-sandwich.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/9b33450a-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-building-sandwich-300x200.jpg 300w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/9b33450a-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-building-sandwich-768x512.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/9b33450a-brian-tsao-mission-sandwich-social-new-york-building-sandwich-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10033\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Emily Schindler.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will confirm to you that I do not have six-pack abs. I drank a lot of six packs, but I also learned a lot of new skills. I learned about cameras, editing, lighting, learning how to manage a YouTube channel. I created a whole YouTube show to keep myself engaged in the world of sandwiches. I basically was filming my R\u0026#038;D for the sandwich shop, whether it was going to happen or not. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured, I\u0026#8217;m already stuck at home. Nothing I can do about this. But I really love this project, so I might as well just keep marching forward. I started sending questionnaires to my closest friends, the quote-unquote celebrities, mainly in the metal world. I sent them a questionnaire, and I created a signature sandwich based on their answers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had all the research done, everything was tested, tried and true. I managed to perfect the bread in that time. When things finally started to open back up, I had a whole foundation, a body of work. I was able to basically say, \u0026#8220;Hey, I\u0026#8217;m ready.\u0026#8221; I\u0026#8217;d say a year later was when I was given the okay to start looking for spaces.

That definitely didn\u0026#8217;t happen.It was a combination of myself and my investors being picky, being very selective of where we opened.

That was a given. But one of our concerns was the history of the location. We didn\u0026#8217;t want to go into a spot that had a lot of history of failed restaurants. Typically, turnkey places have a lot of history of failed restaurants. Another thing was really taking our time and making sure it felt right. What you would think would take a couple weeks multiplied into months and months and months. But I\u0026#8217;m glad we did that, because I\u0026#8217;m very happy with the location we ended up with. It was a laundromat prior to me taking over! \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to managing my time—check in with me in two or three months, see if I\u0026#8217;m in an asylum or not. To be honest, you have to make time. For example, I have my first paid partnership for my YouTube channel with Hello Fresh, so I have to just plan it out like I do everything else. I know that I can\u0026#8217;t bang out this ad in one day. So I filmed the B-roll one day, I\u0026#8217;m filming the monologue another day, and I farmed out the editing to someone else. It\u0026#8217;s just about planning—making the time and committing for that time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI purposely opened Mission Sandwich Social in the late winter or early spring so that I can rev up for the warmer months. Right now is a combination of watching my labor costs, my food costs, and hopefully start running some specials, because I\u0026#8217;m really treating this project like a fine-dining restaurant where we have a seasonal menu, where we run specials, where I give the cook an opportunity to have some input on the menu and be collaborative. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePriority number one, aside from all the stuff that I named off, is customer experience and employee work culture. One thing that I\u0026#8217;m very much an advocate of—and we\u0026#8217;ll see if I made the right move in half a year to a year—is I want the restaurant work culture to be a more positive place. Back of the house can easily become very toxic … underpaid, underappreciated staff and harsh working conditions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing that my investor told me about his philosophy of how he runs businesses is that no one\u0026#8217;s job should ruin their day. I have really dived into that mindset. It\u0026#8217;s making sure that our customers feel a lot of joy and love when they walk in there, and can see that joy and love passing through every staff member from the cook to the dishwasher. Happy staff equals happy customers, and happy customers equal even more happy customers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have the HR talk with everybody that I hire. Right now I am HR. I sit everyone down, and I tell them the whole philosophy that I don\u0026#8217;t believe that your work should ruin your day. But also that it\u0026#8217;s okay to make mistakes, because the successes of my career are built on the bricks of my failures. One of the most important things is that we\u0026#8217;re there to prop each other up, that we\u0026#8217;re there to make each other better. It\u0026#8217;s very common in restaurant culture, especially back of the house, that there\u0026#8217;s a lot of machismo, there\u0026#8217;s a lot of shit-talking. And it\u0026#8217;s hard. I do think that the culture can benefit from a bit more positive energy, a bit more collaborative energy, and propping one another up rather than looking to see what mistakes you are fucking up on and then pointing fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003eBrian Tsao is the former chef at Beauty \u0026#038; Essex and Mira Sushi \u0026#038; Izakaya in New York.

In 2021, he opened \u003ca href=\"https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/sona\"\u003eSona\u003c/a\u003e, an elevated Indian restaurant in the Flatiron neighborhood. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad left the restaurant business after nine years. I don\u0026#8217;t know that I would have hit \u0026#8220;go\u0026#8221; on opening a restaurant myself without those nine years of my life, which left an indelible mark. So in some ways, this felt like it was bigger than a professional aspiration. This was a continuation of my family\u0026#8217;s immigrant story. Even though I was born and raised in Dallas, in America, me getting this restaurant open was, for me, in my blood. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m an insatiable people person. I\u0026#8217;m an extrovert. And as I became a New Yorker over the past 22 years, I would get asked this one question all the time. People were like, \u0026#8220;Oh my God, you seem great, Maneesh. Nice to meet you. Where do you like to have Indian food?\u0026#8221; When I got the question, I didn\u0026#8217;t love that I didn\u0026#8217;t have an answer. I was like, \u0026#8220;I can tell you where to get Japanese food before I can tell you where to have Indian food.\u0026#8221; So for me, it felt like it was a family story.

But then you throw COVID into it, because we broke ground on the space in January of 2020. It\u0026#8217;s worth noting that I\u0026#8217;d lost three spaces before that because landlords had a lot of power, especially because I was a first-time restaurateur. What landlord is going to take a risk on me? So I ended up on my dream block, but it was my fourth attempt at a location. Thankfully I broke through enough and we signed a lease, but it was ultimately untenable. Come the lockdown in March 2020, I had to spend months in serious, heated negotiations. We had to rethink every term we had signed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately we made the case to the landlord that we didn\u0026#8217;t have to open. But the landlord didn’t want to be yet another one of these empty storefronts. So let\u0026#8217;s work towards a solution that works for all parties. Candidly, if we were fully built, it would have been harder. But because we were so new to our game, in some ways we stood on firmer ground. We did find our landlord to be very willing to talk. We both walked into it with the same goal, which is to say, \u0026#8220;Let\u0026#8217;s keep this alive.\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe really went back to the drawing board and said, \u0026#8220;In what world could this exist?\u0026#8221; Without going too much into specifics, we were able to renegotiate in totality so that it was more dependent on the success of the restaurant than it was on a hard and fast number. But ultimately it would kind of catch up to what an original lease might have looked like. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of my journey as a restaurateur, a friend of mine, Ben Leventhal, said to me, \u0026#8220;Nobody matters except your repeat diners.\u0026#8221; I didn\u0026#8217;t really get it then. Now I\u0026#8217;m a year in, and I get it even more. At first, I was like, \u0026#8220;Well, we\u0026#8217;re full every night.\u0026#8221; But now as the honeymoon has subsided, I see that he\u0026#8217;s absolutely right in the sense that I\u0026#8217;m learning how you build a loyal following. You\u0026#8217;re always going to have people that come in and check you off a list. We especially will have those. But what about those that come back and want to have a relationship with the restaurant, and have a relationship with our team, and want to come in for our specials and our menu updates? That is in many respects the most important thing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I\u0026#8217;m realizing is that it\u0026#8217;s about freshness and giving people something that they want to try. Sona is the Hindi word for gold. So we\u0026#8217;ve instituted a Monday to Friday \u0026#8220;golden hour”—between 5 and 6:30pm, there are drink specials and food specials at the bar or in the front dining room. It’s a great place to meet people after work for drinks, for a conversation, and for a catch-up at a pre-dinner hang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe just introduced lunch, as we really are bullish about businesses coming back to the office. It feels like people sometimes have a misconception about what Indian food is and how heavy it might be. So we\u0026#8217;ve introduced a thali, which is basically an Indian version of a bento box, and it\u0026#8217;s delicious and has a lot of customization. You can have rice or you can have no carbs. In terms of the lightness and the quickness of what lunch can be, it offers something different than just a traditional Caesar salad. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there have been a lot of gay and queer and LGBT people employed by restaurants, when it comes to gay restauranteurs or executive chefs, the list isn\u0026#8217;t as long as you might think. Oftentimes, it\u0026#8217;s a business of white men, or white straight men, I should say. Because of that, our Saturday brunch is now hosted by drag queens. And it\u0026#8217;s super fun and light and different and not overwhelming, but it\u0026#8217;s just silly. It\u0026#8217;s very New York. And it’s me stepping into the fact that I am gay and a very, very active member in the community, and very, very out. If there\u0026#8217;s ever going to be an Indian restaurant that has a drag brunch, it should be this one.

Photo: Courtesy Sona.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#8217;m turning what used to be my event marketing business into a hospitality company. So it\u0026#8217;s Sona, but I\u0026#8217;m also a partner in \u003ca href=\"https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/temple-bar\"\u003eTemple Bar\u003c/a\u003e. And shortly I\u0026#8217;m launching a line called Sona Home, which is inspired by the many people who have loved our plateware and our dishware. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have been very deliberate about the experience at Sona because a lot of people have an idea about what India is, or even what an Indian restaurant is. My whole intention was to change that perception—not even change it, widen it. Our plates feature these beautiful palm trees. India is very tropical and has a big beach culture in South India, but people don\u0026#8217;t think of it that way. I relentlessly searched for this plateware because I wasn\u0026#8217;t happy with anything I saw. I just kept clicking on catalogs and showrooms and I finally found these plates that had never been used at a single restaurant in America because they were from a crockery house based in the UK. But then all of our linens that we\u0026#8217;re going to be using and selling through Sona Home are all bespoke to us. We have a whole barware collection, et cetera. And a bunch of the product, of course, is the product we use in Sona itself, but then some of it is new. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I think about Sona, I think about what goes into a great New York restaurant, like \u003ca href=\"https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/balthazar\"\u003eBalthazar\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/indochine\"\u003eIndochine\u003c/a\u003e, which have multi-decade-long staying power. That’s almost unheard of in this industry. The reason is they\u0026#8217;ve been very specific about their experience and very specific about their point of view of who they are as restaurants. You never mind when somebody suggests one of those restaurants. That\u0026#8217;s hard to achieve, and I don\u0026#8217;t pretend that it\u0026#8217;s easy, but that\u0026#8217;s certainly the goal. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould Sona be one of New York\u0026#8217;s great restaurants? Because when I think about New York\u0026#8217;s great restaurants, there are some French restaurants and there are some Asian restaurants, but I don\u0026#8217;t know if there are any Indian restaurants on that list. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026#8217;s funny is that I never imagined Sona to have whie tablecloths. I thought we would use the tabletops because we had designed it with beautiful tabletops. But once we got in there and we opened the restaurant, we knew we needed to have tablecloths to elevate the vibe and the experience. We are not fine dining, but we are definitely elevated dining, and we are fun dining. That\u0026#8217;s where the music, the art, the full experience kind of plays into it. We use vintage saris that we cut up as lampshades on the little lamps that are on each table. As opposed to being overwhelmed by the Indian-ness of it all, we\u0026#8217;ve made a very nice, subtle nod to it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew Yorkers really pick up on it. Others are probably still trying to figure it out because they might be looking for a more traditional Indian restaurant experience. Candidly, that\u0026#8217;s been a little bit of a challenge for us. You can\u0026#8217;t be everything to everybody, but how do you stay true to who you are and who you want to be? That has been a challenge when people come in with a certain expectation. Oftentimes your own family can be your harshest critic. We want to keep everybody happy, but keeping Indians happy might be the hardest thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003eManeesh Goyal grew up in Dallas, where his father owned a restaurant.

href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@chefjonkung\"\u003eTikTok personality\u003c/a\u003e known for his food and cooking videos. Before the pandemic, Kung ran an underground kitchen space in Detroit\u0026#8217;s Eastern Market. Kung describes himself as a “third-culture cook”—referring to the in-between space where different cultures meet and, through cooking, create a new identity. Kung is currently working on his first cookbook with Clarkson Potter. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;Third-culture cooking\u0026#8221; is a term I thought of connected with the term \u0026#8220;third-culture kid\u0026#8221;—also known as global nomads. A third-culture kid is somebody who has an established culture at home—the culture of their parents, the culture of their family, the places they live—but then they\u0026#8217;re removed from that in their greater world, in the sense that their home might be of one culture, but then the country of which that home resides is completely different. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, any Chinese-American, Mexican-American, or Nigerian-American are all certainly American kids, but it can get more complicated than that. There is that separation, where you never fully fit in a place, which is not necessarily bad. People like us are shown to have, for example, a greater capacity for empathy because we\u0026#8217;re so used to different forms of communication. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you grew up in a household where a parent often cooked the food of their home culture, you will understand the tastes and flavors and the ingredients even though you might not be able to read the label on the jar. But you might be able to recognize the jar. And if you ever went into an ethnic grocery store, say 15 years later, and you see that jar, and you\u0026#8217;re like, \u0026#8220;I don\u0026#8217;t know what this is, but it used to be in my house.\u0026#8221;\u0026#8216;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_10005\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10005\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/06/f4404f76-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-shelves.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"2100\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10005\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f4404f76-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-shelves.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f4404f76-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-shelves-200x300.jpg 200w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f4404f76-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-shelves-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f4404f76-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-shelves-683x1024.jpg 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10005\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eDetroit chef and Tiktok creator Jonathan Kung at his studio. Photo: Gerard + Belevender.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was raised in Toronto as a Canadian, and I eventually went back to Hong Kong during my high school ages. I went from a place where people did not look like me to one where almost everybody did, but at the time, I didn\u0026#8217;t relate to them. I still had a missing piece, a strangeness. Not to say that my experience in Hong Kong was bad–it was amazing. But I didn\u0026#8217;t feel like I was ever a part of a place where my home was, wherever I lived. And so those are some really pretty typical common feelings that third-culture kids have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo third-culture cuisine is like an informed fusion of cooking. I don\u0026#8217;t really like the term “fusion” because it was made a little dirty by the food that came out of the 90s. Third-culture cuisine is more informed and nuanced because it comes from a person with a deep understanding of both types of cuisine that person is trying to combine. I think it’s most exciting type of cuisine to come out of countries that are very diverse, such as the United States and Canada, where people are interested in cultural exchange. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the United States was going through its own kind of culinary renaissance with gastropubs and New American restaurants, they were mostly helmed by white men. What they were doing was picking and choosing from surface-level interesting things from diverse sources within the country. When I was younger, and all that was happening, it triggered certain emotions in me—protectionist, gatekeeper-y feelings that I felt strongly about. Then, later on, as I matured as a cook, I realized what I should have been doing was not stopping them from doing what \u003cem\u003ethey\u003c/em\u003e were doing. I should have been \u003cem\u003edoing\u003c/em\u003e what they were doing, and then use my basis in Chinese cuisine as my own addition to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking part in the diversity of the American culinary landscape is not something that only white people should have access to. Every cook of every culture in this country should have access. That’s why I wanted to show these cross-cultural dishes I was doing, but at the same time sharing my vision so that other people who have their own cultures, and who have stories similar to mine, will use that as a basis with their own cultural dishes—as a starting point to try something different. Third-culture cuisine just requires somebody to look for connections between different people. That\u0026#8217;s what makes it a lot of fun, and that\u0026#8217;s what makes it kind of familiar. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_10007\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10007\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/06/de74e0d0-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-knives.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"2100\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10007\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/de74e0d0-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-knives.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/de74e0d0-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-knives-200x300.jpg 200w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/de74e0d0-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-knives-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/de74e0d0-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-knives-683x1024.jpg 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10007\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Gerard + Belevender.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came to this conclusion as a result of a creative identity crisis. I went back to Hong Kong a lot for a while, and I saw what it is like to cook Chinese food there. I learned that my perceptions of Chinese food—traditional Chinese cooking, banquet cuisine and stuff like that, which I was teaching myself—was not what Chinese food meant over there. I was learning such outdated out-of-fashion things, and people there were doing much more interesting things, but still staying within the realm of traditional Cantonese cuisine. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was kind of embarrassed with my idea of myself as a Chinese cook versus the reality. I had to learn a little bit of the culinary history of Chinese food within America to realize that this was me trying to chase authenticity and traditionalism. That was never going to happen all the way from here in Detroit because I wasn\u0026#8217;t willing to move back to Hong Kong to learn it. So what can I do over here, or who can I learn from over here that would set me apart from the people over there? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026#8217;t really interested in learning from the big restaurants. I was more interested in learning from people who, even though they don\u0026#8217;t look, speak, or cook like me, have a similar experience to mine. Having that feeling of that connection is a good starting point. I set out to learn and to incorporate cultural dishes that oftentimes had also been stigmatized, because I feel like cooking with empathy is like the difference between cooking for yourself and cooking and serving others. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom there, I started looking for similarities between cuisines. I would just look at the most subtle things, like Chinese zongzi, which are bamboo leaves wrapped around rice that often hold a salted egg yolk, and some sausage and pork belly, and it’s steamed. I noticed how similar those are to tamales. They\u0026#8217;re both starches that hold things steamed inside the leaves and husks of other things.

I was looking for what somebody from another culture might recognize. This type of cooking does not have to be complicated. I\u0026#8217;m more than happy to show off my skills and creativity as a cook, but I think it\u0026#8217;s so much more fun to do things that have that same creativity and same basis of being diverse, but in ways that almost everyone can do. You can make pasta using dried noodles in a jar, and you can make frozen Chinese dumplings with pesto. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to my videos talking about culinary appropriation, a lot of people may not realize that my sense of gatekeeping is probably more liberal than they expect. I\u0026#8217;m kind of anti-gatekeeping for a lot of things. \u0026#8220;Cook our food but respect the people\u0026#8221; is the message that I have been going with for the past few years. I got a lot of duets and stitches on Tiktok from people trying out my ideas. A lot of people were very receptive to them, saying, \u0026#8220;This was kind of obvious. Why didn\u0026#8217;t anyone think of this before?\u0026#8221; \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there were some dismissive comments, like, \u0026#8220;Well, this guy just invented ravioli, again.\u0026#8221; I was like, \u0026#8220;Well, no, no, not really. You just don\u0026#8217;t really know the nuances of a Chinese dumpling versus a ravioli.\u0026#8221; The fact that I still see new comments about those videos to this day means people still talk about them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s often within our own communities where we attack ourselves. One of the reasons I think that happens is because there is this underlying guilt from being so othered as kids, so shamed for eating the foods that we did, for having the customs that we did. We might have been embarrassed by these things as children, so maybe we shunned them until we realized in our adult life that these things were valuable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_10001\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10001\" style=\"width: 1400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/zagat-images/2022/06/438a2840-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-stoop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"2100\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10001\" srcset=\"https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/438a2840-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-stoop.jpg 1400w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/438a2840-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-stoop-200x300.jpg 200w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/438a2840-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-stoop-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://infatuation.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/438a2840-jonathan-kung-tiktok-detroit-national-stoop-683x1024.jpg 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10001\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ePhoto: Gerard + Belevender.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if there was a specific dish that our grandma made for us, and then we see somebody else—possibly someone who looks like us—cooking it differently, we get super defensive. A person might say, \u0026#8220;That\u0026#8217;s not how you make it. You\u0026#8217;re totally inauthentic. You\u0026#8217;re not doing it right. That\u0026#8217;s not how that dish is done.\u0026#8221; When in fact, that person isn’t an expert about the food, they\u0026#8217;re just an expert about their memory. Through that guilt and embarrassment and shame, they lash out, and they want to claim what little hold they still have on those really important memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a person who has been very active on social media, I see the cycles and the patterns of everything, how people jump on these things. It happens year by year, generation by generation. The stories seem to repeat themselves, especially for folks in POC communities. I\u0026#8217;m not saying it\u0026#8217;s a tired story, but we have to harness it into something a little different. That\u0026#8217;s my personal belief. Embracing diversity from a third-culture perspective is me taking ownership of what I like. I\u0026#8217;m not fully a person from Hong Kong. I\u0026#8217;m not fully Chinese or Chinese-American. What does that mean? What does that mean to me? If I were to cook my identity, what does that look like? By doing this, I’m taking ownership of my identity, and I take ownership of my narrative and my creative output as a result. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of people who are the most outspoken gatekeepers about food barely know how to cook. So what are they guarding? I\u0026#8217;m not diminishing people\u0026#8217;s pain. I\u0026#8217;m just questioning whether or not the way that they handle that pain is probably the most effective way to do it. Therapy can be delicious, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003eJonathan Kung is a Detroit chef and TikTok personality known for his food and cooking videos.
