She traveled the world helping developing nations confront their lack of mental health resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want people to know what I know — that today because of research and our knowledge of the brain, mental illnesses can be diagnosed and treated effectively, and the majority of those with these illnesses can recover and lead fulfilling lives … going to school, working, raising a family, and being productive citizens in their communities,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the height of the Carters’ political power, the Washington press corps of the late 1970s dubbed Rosalynn Carter “the Steel Magnolia,” reflecting the quiet grace stereotypical of the era’s Southern political wives and a tough core that made her a force on her husband’s behalf and in her own right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She knew what she wanted to accomplish,” said Kathy Cade, a White House adviser to Rosalynn Carter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpanding the role of first lady, she worked in her own office in the East Wing with her own staff and on her own initiatives. She also huddled with the president’s advisers and sat in on top-level meetings, raising eyebrows in Washington power circles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She didn’t say anything in Cabinet meetings, but she wanted to be fully informed so she could give her husband good advice,” said Carter biographer Jonathan Alter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlter considers Rosalynn Carter’s only peers as influential first ladies to be Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Clinton, although he said the Carters’ partnership was more seamless, because it lacked the infidelity and personal drama of the Roosevelts and Clintons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bond also involved friendly rivalry and humor: “I never knew I’d be married to somebody that old,” Jimmy Carter wisecracked when his wife was 91.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey often raced to finish writing their next books or tried to best the other in tennis, skiing or any other pursuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalynn Carter was at the center of her husband's political campaigns, starting with his first state Senate race in 1962.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the beginning, I wrote letters to people. He would go out and then I would write letters to them,” she told The Associated Press. “But then it developed into a full-time job for me, working to help him get elected.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe first campaigned solo during Jimmy Carter's 1966 bid for governor. She was initially nervous but warmed to the role and ultimately demonstrated what White House adviser Stuart Eizenstat called “uncanny political instinct.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the White House, it was Rosalynn Carter who urged her husband to think more about the 1980 election as he set priorities, and talk through how decisions might play in the media. When Jimmy Carter stayed in Washington to work every angle to free the American hostages in Iran, the first lady hit his reelection campaign trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I campaigned solid every day the last time we ran,” she told the AP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer emphasis on mental health and reducing stigma traced back to her husband’s Georgia campaigns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoters “would stand patiently” waiting to tell of their family struggles, she once wrote. After hearing one overnight mill worker’s story of caring for her afflicted child, Rosalynn Carter decided to take the issue to the candidate.

Most of the $50 million to $80 million in annual savings from the plan would come from discontinuing the approximately $80 million paid in management fees and incentives to PSEG each year for a team of 19 managers.

He had also asked that the union receive a voting seat on the board, a concession made late Thursday, two people familiar with the talks said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePSEG has publicly opposed the plan, saying that the current public-private partnership has worked best for Long Island ratepayers, despite its failures during Tropical Storm Isaias and in recent performance report cards.

potentially allow more off-road driving for Fire Island residents and workers during the non-summer months, a move that residents hope will allow for greater transportation flexibility while still protecting the character of the barrier island.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Park Service held a pair of meetings — one in person and another virtually — with residents this week where they presented three alternatives to Fire Island's driving regulations, which have remained unchanged for 37 years.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe first would leave the current regulations, which were established in 1987 and aim to preserve the roadless nature of the barrier island and protect its seashores, unchanged.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMany homes can only be reached via boat or by driving on federal land, which requires a permit. No driving, even with a permit, is allowed during the summer months.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA second option would increase the cap on year-round residential driving permits from 145 to 200 while the cap on business and construction vehicles would grow from 80 to 145, officials said. The cap for public utilities and essential services would be removed. Meanwhile, the seasonal driving window would be modified to allow residents all-day driving privileges during the school year.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA third option, officials said, would allow all eligible year-round residents and construction/businesses to obtain a driving permit while the caps would be removed. But full-time and part-time residents, along with municipal employees and those providing essential services, would only be allowed to drive on weekdays while businesses could drive all week through the first Friday in May.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere would still be strict requirements to obtain a permit, such as proof of residency or business on Fire Island.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eResidents have previously shared with the Park Service that they need loosened permit regulations, making it easier to drive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThomas Ruskin, president of Fire Island's Seaview association, said there is support from many in the community to incorporate\u0026nbsp;portions of the three options presented by the Park Service into one final plan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor example, Ruskin, who has lived on the island for more than 60 years, said the Park Service's\u0026nbsp;process for determining who is qualified for a driving permit is working fine.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut, he believes the number of permits needs to be adjusted slightly up to reflect the island's growing population and that the driving season should halt well before the end of the school year, as the area has already seen its population grow exponentially by that point.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026quot;I am hoping that [the Park Service] earnestly listen to the community leaders and take into account what we say, because we know what happens inland better than anyone else,\u0026quot; Ruskin said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026quot;They are very good at what they do and how they protect the federal tracts.

against officials she alleges ignored years of warnings\u0026nbsp;of abuse, beatings, starvation and neglect before the 8-year-old autistic boy died of hypothermia in January 2020 after being forced

million\u0026nbsp;offer\u0026nbsp;was disclosed in a 108-page motion Justyna Zubko-Valva\u0026nbsp;filed on her own behalf as the federal lawsuit grinded to a halt this week when her attorney was granted permission to exit the case.\u0026nbsp;Zubko-Valva, of Valley Stream, also\u0026nbsp;disclosed in her filing that she was willing to settle the case for\u0026nbsp;$30 million.\u0026nbsp;When she learned the $3 million covered all defendants in the case, settlement talks broke down, the court filing shows.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn Zubko-Valva’s motion filed Saturday, she called the county’s $3 million offer “humiliating.” She argued that\u0026nbsp;after she would have paid her lawyer, Jon Norinsberg of Manhattan,\u0026nbsp;his fees, the settlement would “leave almost nothing” for her two surviving children.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Was this your grand plan from the beginning of this case to ensure that my children, who suffered such tremendous and horrific abuse that resulted in my son Tommy’s brutal murder, would be left with nothing?” Zubko-Valva asked her attorney in a July email. “That’s unspeakable and shameful.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNorinsberg said a “complete breakdown” occurred this year over “sharp disagreements” between him and Zubko-Valva over “case strategy, the scope of discovery and the best way to move forward in this case.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eU.S. Magistrate Judge Arlene Lindsay on Thursday stayed the case until Jan. 14\u0026nbsp;to give Zubko-Valva two months to\u0026nbsp;find a new lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“It

attorney\u0026nbsp;change comes more than three years after Zubko-Valva filed her $200 million claim against Suffolk, several of its Child Protective Services employees, East Moriches school officials and several attorneys tasked with protecting\u0026nbsp;Thomas Valva and his two brothers. Zubko-Valva was going through a bitter divorce proceeding and custody battle with the boys’ father, Michael Valva, a former NYPD officer who is serving a 25-years-to-life sentence for the murder of Thomas. Valva’s fiancee, Angela Pollina, is serving the same sentence for her role in the boy’s death, and she and Valva are also defendants in the civil suit.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA contract included in the Zubko-Valva filing shows Norinsberg was to receive 33 1/3% of the total amount recovered from the lawsuit, a standard fee in such cases, plus $650 per hour in attorney’s fees. Lindsay’s decision notes that Norinsberg intends to pursue a lien for work performed on the case.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNorinsberg first informed the court of his desire to exit the case, along with co-counsel Jin-Young Han, in a Sept. 22 letter. In an email Thursday, Norinsberg told Newsday he had “no comments to make, as the record speaks for itself.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I sincerely wish Ms. Valva and her children the best of luck in the future,” Norinsberg wrote.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSuffolk officials did not respond to request for comment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTwo Suffolk juries found Thomas died after Michael Valva and Pollina forced him and his brother Anthony to sleep in the unheated garage at their home as temperatures outside fell to just 19 degrees.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAuthorities have said all three Valva boys, including brothers Anthony and Andrew, were frequently denied food or access to toilets, and often were sent to school in soiled, urine-soaked clothing. Prosecutors described the Valva and Pollina home on Bittersweet Lane as a “house of horrors.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA special grand jury was impaneled to investigate the circumstances surrounding Thomas’ death and make recommendations on reforming Child Protective Services, the judiciary and law enforcement. The county also appointed committees to investigate the death and propose reforms.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut a Newsday investigation published in May revealed that more than three years after the boy’s death, some investigations into the county's child-welfare system that were promised had not been completed or never started.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe state has not released a report that is critical of Suffolk Child Protective Services and the county district attorney's office, led first by former Suffolk County District Attorney Timothy Sini and now under Ray Tierney, has not released findings of the investigation that was promised.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Newsday investigation also found that three Suffolk County Child Protective Services employees who played key roles in the agency’s investigations into abuse allegations against Valva and Pollina were promoted after the boy’s death.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe saga of the boy’s death shook their Center Moriches community and garnered significant media attention during the two trials held late last year and in the spring.

It was a call for the country to be better, to not waste the sacrifices of so many who have come before us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMany now think there is much wrong with our country. I prefer to think that there is more right. We’re not perfect, but we need to stay dedicated to the “great task remaining before us,” as we have for generations.

We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate — we can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e— President Abraham Lincoln\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNov. 19, 1863\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch3\u003eNegative campaigns should be outlawed\u003c/h3\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI am increasingly appalled by how candidates electioneer.

It was Law’s sister, Susan, who worked in a Smithtown pub on Main Street frequented by the town’s Republicans including Nicky Barbato, Patrick Henry and William Carney, the only Conservative elected to the House of Representatives from New York. Susan Law\u0026nbsp;let the pols know that her brother was a political science major at Stony Brook University looking to get involved in the game, which led to Law working on the campaign of Carney’s chief of staff, Rick Schmidt, who was making a run for Smithtown Town\u0026nbsp;supervisor against a carpetbagger Democrat from New York City, Patrick Vecchio. Vecchio went on to hold the office for 40 years.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith no Smithtown job in the offing for the student, Carney contacted Romaine, then head of the Brookhaven Community Development office which was located in the same building as Carney’s district office.

Romaine told him that Brookhaven Supervisor Henrietta Acampora, reviewing the paperwork for new hires, saw Law's address.\u0026nbsp;“Why am I paying $4 an hour to someone who lives in Smithtown,” she said, invoking the first tribal rule of GOP patronage.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I remember the incident,” Romaine told The Point in a text. “It’s something we laugh about all of the time,” adding that since then they have had a long and close relationship.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCarpenter, too, goes back with Romaine almost four decades, first from her days with the Suffolk County Republican Women and then with their political careers overlapping when she was county treasurer and he served in the county legislature. \u0026quot;He's a little on the serious side, but he does have a very soft side, too,\u0026quot; Carpenter told the Point.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRomaine met with his co-chairs on Friday and it’s expected that other members of the transition team will be announced early next week. “Angie and Kevin are only focused on what we will need to do to make sure we move Suffolk County forward,” said Romaine.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e— Rita Ciolli \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003erita.ciolli@newsday.com\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003ePencil Point\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003ch3\u003eGoing, going,\u0026nbsp;con\u003c/h3\u003e \n\u003ca class=\"p-smartembed\" data-attr-caption=\"\" data-attr-credit=\"\" data-attr-f=\"3x2\" data-attr-has-caption=\"true\" data-attr-has-credit=\"true\" data-attr-q=\"0.3\" data-attr-w=\"400\" data-onecms-id=\"contentid/290564c3-2306-4a18-a813-ff3185e47b2a\" data-onecms-type=\"image\" href=\"javascript:window.parent.actionEventData({$contentId:'contentid/290564c3-2306-4a18-a813-ff3185e47b2a', $action:'view', $target:'work'})\" polopoly:contentid=\"contentid/290564c3-2306-4a18-a813-ff3185e47b2a\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/image-service/alias/contentid/290564c3-2306-4a18-a813-ff3185e47b2a/b8c81a10058d394559f5f145580558f9c9279a23.jpg?f=3x2\u0026amp;w=400\u0026amp;q=0.3\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor more cartoons, visit \u003ca href=\"https://www.newsday.com/opinion/cartoons/national-political-cartoons-newsday-o78euzm7\"\u003ewww.newsday.com/nationalcartoons\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003eFinal Point\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003ch3\u003ePolitical speed bumps ahead\u003c/h3\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAmong the many issues that emerged throughout the local legislative elections, one had near-universal agreement: The roads need work.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, a key regional advocate is already looking to next year’s elections and says roads should be a top issue in evaluating state and federal candidates, too.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so far, no one seems to be making road repairs and upgrades the priority it should be, Marc Herbst, the executive director of the Long Island Contractors’ Association, told The Point this week.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s going to stand up and be the champion for Long Island infrastructure?” Herbst asked. “We haven’t had one since Chuck Fuschillo.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFuschillo, a former Republican state senator, served as chairman of the State Senate’s transportation committee. Herbst noted that since Fuschillo left the State Senate in 2013, LICA has found that the percentage of local roads with pavement ratings in “fair to poor” condition has increased from 14% to 40%.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHerbst’s frustration comes in the wake of a report from the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, a Washington\u0026nbsp;think tank, that found that the federal infrastructure investment act, now two years old, allocated $4.5 billion for highway and roads-related funding for New York State, but less than $2 billion of it has been allocated within the state\u0026nbsp;Department of Transportation's five-year capital plan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLong Island will receive on average $333.4 million per year between 2023 and 2027 — an increase of 1% from 2022 levels. Herbst said the region will see an approximate\u0026nbsp;$14 million total increase in allocations over those five years. That’s less than 1% of the $2 billion the state has allocated — and even less when considering the $4.5 billion overall allocated to the state.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHerbst met with representatives from Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office more than a month ago but is still waiting to see what local legislators do next. LICA members, he said, will be focused on the issue as budget negotiations begin early next year — and are looking for the region’s lawmakers to fill the leadership vacuum.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf they don’t, Herbst warned, the issue could become a significant one come campaign time.

Kennedy Jr., is mounting a presidential challenge to Biden. What began as a sort of nuisance challenge in the Democratic primary quickly morphed into an independent presidential bid — and a potential problem for both Biden and former President Donald Trump. With his famous name and none-of-the-above platform, Kennedy just posted a healthy 22% share of the vote in two recent national polls that tested a three-way race between Kennedy, Biden and Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not exactly clear who Kennedy would damage the most since his hodgepodge of policies seem to draw as much from Trump’s COVID skeptics as Biden’s progressive base. Add to that a plurality of independent voters, as Kennedy did in those polls, and you’ve got a potential race on your hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral things have to happen for an independent candidate to actually become viable in a presidential contest in America, not the least of which is getting onto the ballot in all 50 states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Kennedy has made it clear in several interviews recently that Georgia is one of five battleground states he’s most focused on. It may surprise you to know that he’s already been to Georgia more this year than Trump and Biden combined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince launching his independent bid, Kennedy stumped in Duluth and Atlanta in September, in Augusta in October and in Savannah just last week. Along with the question of whether he’ll actually be on the 2024 ballot, which will require thousands of Georgians’ signatures, the bigger question for voters considering him is…who is this guy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe know he’s got the famous last name and blue eyes of the Kennedys, but is he an eccentric kook, as he’s often portrayed in the press, or an independent’s’ savior? He’s offered a trail of clues during his visits here so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first glance, or listen, the raspy-voiced lawyer’s declarations could be music to any independent’s ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not doing this to serve some need for my ego, I’m doing this because I know I can change this country and bring it back,” he told attendees at his Duluth rally. “The way they keep us from doing it is they have us all fighting each other. They turn Blacks against whites...they turn Democrats against Republicans, at each other’s throats.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that event and others he focused heavily on economic issues like home ownership, which many voters under 30 could tell you feels more out of reach than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The American dream has turned into a nightmare,” he says in one social media post. “When Americans become renters, we go from citizens to serfs on our own land, where the big shots own all the land and all the homes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut along with his independent message and middle-class mantra, he’s also got more than the average bear’s level of conspiracy-adjacent language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpread across his message of unity are lots of “theys” — the bankers and the billionaires he said are behind nearly everything wrong in America over the last 50 years, from the Vietnam War to 9/11 to COVID.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazon got to close its competitors during COVID, he said in Duluth, and then they censored his book that detailed it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Augusta, he said, “My uncle realized that the purpose of the intelligence agencies was to provide us a pipeline of constant wars. We’re addicted to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what about the vaccines? He said in a recent interview on The NewsHour that his position as an anti-vaxxer has been overblown by the press. He said in the same interview he considers all abortions a tragedy, but that the decision ought to stay with women. He said he’d “seal” the Southern border and create a universal “passport card” for all Americans to easily prove their work status at jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo is he wonderful? Or a weirdo? His family members seem to think he’s the latter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the day he announced he’d swapped from a Democratic bid to an independent bid, which could turn him into a spoiler for Joe Biden, his siblings called his run against Biden dangerous for the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bobby might share the same name as our father,” they wrote in a statement. “But he does not share the same values, vision or judgment. Today’s announcement is deeply saddening for us. We denounce his candidacy and believe it to be perilous for our country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nephew, Jack Schlosberg accused him of “trading in on Camelot, celebrity, conspiracy theories and conflict for personal gain and fame.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’re all voting for Biden. But they’re not speaking for all Americans or even all Democrats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould he be a spoiler? Of course. But he doesn’t seem to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Democrats are frightened that I’m going to spoil the election for President Biden, and the Republicans are frightened that I’m going to spoil it for Trump,” said RFK Jr. at his announcement rally. “My intention is to spoil it for both of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no way to know now whether Kennedy will be the next Ralph Nader, the next Ross Perot, or greater or less than them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he’s sitting high enough in the polls now that Biden and Trump should understand that Robert Kennedy’s son isn’t satisfied with being in the background in the Oval Office. He wants to be out front.\u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2023-11-17T17:00:00Z","updatedDate":"2023-11-17T16:31:40.069Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/opinion/commentary/robert-f-kennedy-jr-pas8jgi6","headline":"A blue-eyed Kennedy is running for president.

Over the next several years, she said she worked her way up to advertising manager and then marketing director.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Benton said she wanted to “move out of the client side [of the business] and be on the agency side,” so in 1980, she formed her own agency, Benton Associates. The agency specialized in technology advertising and public relations for 10 years until it was acquired by Bozell, one of the top advertising agencies in the world at the time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBenton said she spent another 20 years working for various agencies, helping to guide marketing campaigns and implementing advertising strategies for top consumer technology firms.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen she started The Three Tomatoes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe digital magazine, written by 30 contributors in fields like psychology, fashion and travel, found success quickly. The late celebrity gossip columnist Liz Smith and restaurant critic and author Gael Greene were early contributors, Benton said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBenton said the company’s name is a “fun, retro way to say a smart, savvy woman without having to mention age.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Our subscribers are ‘tomatoes,’ and I’m the head tomato,” she said with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, Benton folded her consulting firm to focus on growing the company’s subscriber base. Today, the company publishes seven newsletters weekly and each issue features about 30 articles on topics like health and wellness, travel, finding love online and home and community, Benton said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMother-daughter team\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSince its inception, Jenkins, who also has a background in advertising, has been a key part of The Three Tomatoes team. Although Jenkins also lives in Glen Cove, the pair maintain separate offices, relaying messages about business and family life via phone, text and email, she said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOver her lifetime, Jenkins said she is grateful for her mother’s influence, which has shaped her into the woman she is today.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Like my mom, I’m a full-time working mother,” Jenkins said. “I take on extra projects, volunteerism, my kids’ schools and charities in my community that I’m passionate about.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA recipient of the Brava award from SmartCEO magazine, which honors women making a difference, Benton was also elected to the Business Marketing Association’s Hall of Fame and received the G.D.

She also chaired the New York City Leadership Council for Plan International USA, a nonprofit that advances children’s rights and equality for girls.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBenton’s early business associate and close friend, Joanne Davis of Manhattan, said while she admires Benton’s smarts and savvy, it is her good-natured personality and kindness that make her stand out.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDavis recalled that after her husband’s death in 2020 from COVID-19, Benton was the first friend who stepped up to craft a memorial video to celebrate her husband’s life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the kind of friend she is,” Davis said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBooks, talent shows and a podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to running The Three Tomatoes, Benton contributed to “Leading Women: 20 Influential Women Share Their Secrets to Leadership, Business and Life,” published in 2014, and authored her first novel “Can You See Us Now?,” which came out in 2018, followed by the sequel, “Can You Hear Us Now?” in 2021. She and Jenkins also co-wrote “Martini Wisdom” in 2018, which was No. 1 on Amazon’s hot new releases, and “More Martini Wisdom” in 2022.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBenton said she was approached by several women who had a book idea or wanted help publishing their own manuscripts. With the goal of “letting other women’s voices be heard,” she said she started The Three Tomatoes Book Publishing in 2019.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSince the launch, her book publishing company has turned out 41 titles, with 12 in the pipeline, Benton said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I get so much satisfaction from helping women become first-time authors,” said Benton, who edits the manuscripts along with professional copy editors. “Part of our success is that we do a lot of hand holding through the process and spend time with our writers.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe company also holds several networking and educational events each year. Recently, it hosted a salon for its first-time authors. “The women read passages from their books and provided tips to one another,” Benton said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBenton, along with co-producer Randie Levine-Miller, also launched a talent competition showcasing older women, many of whom are doctors, lawyers, psychotherapists — and even a rabbi.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“We have auditions and performances at the Triad Theater in New York City,” she said. “It’s mostly singers and some stand-up comedians. Once we had a belly dancer who had abs that a 20-year-old would be jealous of and a blues singer who was 87 years old.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBenton, Jenkins and Levine-Miller select a dozen finalists out of about 40 competitors. Then a celebrity panel of judges, which has included Tony Award-winning Broadway producers, actors and singers, selects four finalists to perform in the show.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBenton also produces and hosts a monthly podcast, “The Three Tomatoes Happy Hour,” which features topics like “Self-Care Strategies for Stress, Anxiety, Depression and Grief” and “Why Anti-Wrinkle Creams and Products Are Fairy Tales.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNew to The Three Tomatoes event lineup is the upcoming holiday networking event “Sip, Shop and Mingle,” at New York City’s Scandinavia House, a Nordic cultural center that features film series, concerts and exhibitions. And in May, a “renewal” summit is planned, also at the Scandinavia House. Topics will include health and wellness, aging gracefully and dating in midlife. Benton said supermodel and writer Paulina Porizkova was the event’s celebrity guest last year.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“The second half of our lives can be the most fulfilling of all,” Benton said. “It’s the time of life when we start to know who we are, understand our strengths and can pursue the things we are passionate about.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e","publishedDate":"2023-11-17T10:00:00Z","updatedDate":"2023-11-17T19:12:08.542Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/li-life/three-tomatoes-cheryl-benton-wwstgm18","headline":"The Three Tomatoes: Cheryl Benton of Glen Cove starts company to celebrate women at every age","teaserTitle":"Navigating midlife and beyond: Glen Cove woman starts company to celebrate women at every age","newsLabel":"none","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","gridFilter":[],"contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.LongIsland.d","title":"Long Island","path":"/long-island","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.LongIsland.LILife.d","title":"LI Life","path":"/long-island/li-life","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/7f6fe327-0e26-442b-bcd6-484985f6fac4","title":"A2COV231119","path":"/long-island/li-life/three-tomatoes-cheryl-benton-wwstgm18","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[{"headline":"Donna Kutt Nahas","name":"Donna Kutt Nahas","role":null,"imageUrl":"","authorUrl":"/author/donna-kutt-nahas-sbpnsgic","authorPage":"","authorBio":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tDonna Kutt Nahas is a freelance writer.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","deactivated":false,"twitterId":"","tikTokId":"","instagramId":"","emailAddress":"Special to Newsday","url":"https://www.newsday.com/donna-kutt-nahas-sbpnsgic","__typename":"Author"}],"topElement":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/e2e1f940-4cf6-40ad-837b-392e0565ea4c","width":2100,"height":1406,"title":"a2cov231119_photos","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://cdn.newsday.com/image-service/version/c:YzFlMDM0ZjctMjgyMi00:N2FkNjM0/a2cov231119_photos.jpg","caption":"\u003cp\u003eCheryl Benton of Glen Cove.\u003c/p\u003e\n","altTag":"","byline":"Danielle Silverman","organization":"","floatLeft":false,"floatRight":false,"imageSize":"","useFreeform":false},"topMediaItem":null,"verticalMedia":null,"relatedLinks":[]}},{"id":"contentid/MjA3OTczNGMtZGFjYi00","__typename":"Teaser","title":"5 LIers charged in scheme to smuggle fentanyl into Suffolk jail","teaserOvertitle":null,"text":"The scheme involved efforts to smuggle high amounts of fentanyl into the jail in Riverhead on pieces of paper disguised as legal documents.","longText":"","customLogo":null,"media":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/9d00e682-0148-4df7-9b55-1cad9826ece7","width":2100,"height":1581,"title":"liFENT231117_photos","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://cdn.newsday.com/image-service/version/c:OGMyYThmMDEtZjVjNC00:YTk3NTg5/lifent231117_photos.jpg","caption":"\u003cp\u003eSuffolk District Attorney Ray Tierney\u0026nbsp;announces the indictment of five people for conspiring to smuggle fentanyl into the Suffolk jail at a news conference\u0026nbsp;Thursday as Sheriff Errol D.

It splits the deadlines for passing full-year appropriations bills into two dates: Jan. 19 for some federal agencies and Feb. 2 for others, creating two dates when there will be a risk of a partial government shutdown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two-step approach was championed by new House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, and was not favored by many in the Senate, though all but one Democrat and 10 Republicans supported it because it ensured the government would not shut down for now. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Johnson has vowed that he will not support any further stopgap funding measures, known as continuing resolutions. He portrayed the temporary funding bill as setting the ground for a spending “fight” with the Senate next year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spending bill does not include the White House’s nearly $106 billion request for wartime aid for Israel and Ukraine. Nor does it provide humanitarian funding for Palestinians and other supplemental requests, including money for border security.

He also agreed that he owed restitution totaling amounts that will be decided at his sentencing hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric Bland, a lawyer who represented the family of the late housekeeper, said the guilty plea will allow victims — 18 total, according to Waters — “to begin the process of healing.” Bland added that the hearing later this month will allow victims to “look Alex Murdaugh in the eye” and say “how they feel about him, how he manipulated them, and the damage that they have done to them in their lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurdaugh is already serving life in prison without parole after a sensational March trial resulted in guilty verdicts on two counts of murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lawyers are seeking a new trial in that case, citing allegations that the court clerk tampered with the jury. The clerk has denied the accusations that she improperly swayed jurors. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurdaugh recently admitted his guilt to 22 federal counts of financial fraud and money laundering. \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2023-11-17T19:20:53.619Z","updatedDate":"2023-11-17T22:43:52.266Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/Alex-Murdaugh-murder-crime-money-n68798","headline":"Alex Murdaugh pleads guilty to financial crimes in a deal that gives him more prison time","teaserTitle":"Alex Murdaugh pleads guilty to financial crimes in a deal that gives him more prison time","newsLabel":"","newsLabel2":"","subType":"article","gridFilter":[],"contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.News.d","title":"News","path":"/news","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.News.Nation.d","title":"Nation/World","path":"/news/nation","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/04798d37-9ea9-4d45-80ae-c0831e0cc670","title":"AP-US--Alex Murdaugh-Financial Crimes, 4th Ld-Writethru","path":"/news/nation/Alex-Murdaugh-murder-crime-money-n68798","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[],"topElement":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/1add0202-5cb2-4869-91f5-70a8073f2d95","width":2100,"height":1399,"title":"US—Alex-Murdaugh-Financial-Crimes","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://cdn.newsday.com/image-service/version/c:MTBlYTc5YzktZWYyZC00:YTQ0YWZl/usalex-murdaugh-financial-crimes.jpeg","caption":"Convicted murderer Alex Murdaugh speaks with his defense attorney, Dick Harpootlian, in Beaufort, S.C. on Friday, Nov. 17, 2023.

Capital One Arena, RJ Barrett was clapping for his teammates, dressed in a cream-colored sweatsuit. A few seats over, Quentin Grimes was in street clothes, too. He was\u0026nbsp;unable to clap, though, because his left arm was encased in a large\u0026nbsp; soft cast.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut whatever the reasons for the missing pieces, Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau has always maintained that the team will turn to the next man up and insist, “We have more than enough.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat mantra was put to the test Friday as the Knicks took on one of the league’s worst teams and recorded\u0026nbsp;a 120-99 win that improved them\u0026nbsp;to 7-5 overall and 1-1 in the in-season tournament. The Wizards are 2-10, 0-3.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“We’re gonna say this every single time something happens like this: Next-up mentality,” Jalen Brunson said. “Next man up. It’s not just one person stepping up. It’s everyone stepping up. We have a lot of great pieces on this team. A lot of great individuals that can do a lot of great things. We can put that all together and play together, and that’s something special.''\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Knicks had a 21-point second-quarter lead cut to five early in the fourth quarter. Until Brunson —\u0026nbsp;who led the Knicks with 32 points, seven\u0026nbsp;rebounds and seven\u0026nbsp;assists — hit a\u0026nbsp;three-pointer from the top of the key with 4:44 to play, pushing the lead to 13,\u0026nbsp;it never felt safe,\u0026nbsp;even if the Wizards hardly seemed to have the firepower to pull out a game down the stretch.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAfter a Washington timeout and an empty possession, the Knicks had two chances and then a third as Brunson dived\u0026nbsp;on the floor between three Wizards players, forcing a jump ball \u0026nbsp;and winning it. Julius Randle sank two free throws with 3:36 to play before a\u0026nbsp;three-pointer by Immanuel Quickley with 2:59 left pushed the Knicks' lead\u0026nbsp;to 18 and gave them\u0026nbsp;a chance to exhale.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I like how we kinda responded from their run when they cut it to five,” Randle said. “That team can score the ball. Despite their record, they’ve got a lot of talent over there. The margin of error in the NBA is very small, so you can never really look at someone’s record and define them, so I’m kinda happy the way we responded to their run and closed out the game.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eQuickley had a season-high 27 points off the bench in front of family and friends from nearby Maryland. Randle added\u0026nbsp;22 points, eight\u0026nbsp;assists and seven\u0026nbsp;rebounds.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith the lead back to 20 and 2:19 left, Thibodeau emptied the bench — at least what was left of it. The Knicks already had to use much of the bench just to get through the game, with Evan Fournier making his first appearance of the season and playing nearly 16 minutes. And in in-season tournament games, point differential comes into play as a tiebreaker — as if Thibodeau needed motivation to play to the final buzzer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“[Shoot], when did we come out? With 2:16?” Randle said. “And he was even debating it then. So I think we got enough run tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith Barrett and Grimes sidelined, the Knicks inserted Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo into\u0026nbsp;the starting lineup, and although they had barely played at all this season as a group with\u0026nbsp;Randle,\u0026nbsp;Brunson and\u0026nbsp;Robinson, it seemed just fine at the start.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Knicks didn’t need time to acclimate to the new lineup, taking a\u0026nbsp;16-4 lead in the opening minutes and building the lead to 21 in the second quarter.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“They’ve been mixing and matching,\u0026nbsp;so they’re comfortable,” Thibodeau said of the plugged-in starting lineup.\u0026nbsp;\u0026quot;That’s the beauty. Quick is comfortable with both units. I think Donte is comfortable with both units. So there’s not much of an adjustments for those guys. And Isaiah [Hartenstein], I’d like to find him more minutes, but Mitch has played at such a high level, there hasn’t been minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2023-11-18T03:06:41.727Z","updatedDate":"2023-11-18T04:04:11.444Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/sports/basketball/knicks/in-season-tournament-knicks-wizards-knglcbms","headline":"Shorthanded Knicks pull away from Wizards for first in-season tournament victory","teaserTitle":"Knicks pull away from Wizards for first in-season tournament win","newsLabel":"none","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","gridFilter":[],"contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.d","title":"Sports","path":"/sports","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.Basketball.d","title":"Basketball","path":"/sports/basketball","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.Basketball.Knicks.d","title":"New York Knicks","path":"/sports/basketball/knicks","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/bcb583f5-0547-43ba-ae95-8a03de3f239e","title":"SPKGAME231118","path":"/sports/basketball/knicks/in-season-tournament-knicks-wizards-knglcbms","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[{"headline":"Steve Popper","name":"Steve Popper","role":"Basketball Columnist","imageUrl":"https://cdn.newsday.com/image-service/version/c:YzFlYzU1N2EtMDY5MS00:M2Q0MTUz/image.jpeg","authorUrl":"/author/steve-popper","authorPage":"","authorBio":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tSteve Popper covers the Knicks for Newsday.

So, until president/general manager Lou Lamoriello answers differently, there will be questions about coach Lane Lambert’s job security barring a rapid turnaround.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut the better question is whether Islanders\u0026nbsp;ownership can allow Lamoriello to make a second coaching change in less than two seasons if he proposes one. Or should ownership, specifically majority owner Scott Malkin, consider more sweeping changes and start an organizational rebuild with an eye to the future rather than trying to squeeze into the playoffs this season.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Islanders (5-6-5) conclude their road trip on Saturday against the Flames at Scotiabank Saddledome after Thursday night’s 4-3 eight-round shootout loss to the Kraken. The previous night, the Islanders lost 4-3 in overtime to the Canucks.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo the Islanders could return home on an eight-game skid after fans chanted for Lambert’s firing in the previous game at UBS Arena and for Lamoriello’s ouster in the home game before that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLambert, promoted to replace his longtime boss Barry Trotz prior to last season, was asked following Wednesday’s game about the responsibility he feels during this losing streak —\u0026nbsp;code for whether he’s concerned about his job security. Lambert specifically cited the penalty kill struggles —\u0026nbsp;more on that in a second —\u0026nbsp;but noted, “We’re in it together.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I 100% percent feel for them,” Lambert said of his players. “There’s nobody that wants to win more than them. For whatever reason right now we’re not getting rewarded. But there’s only one thing to do and that is to keep going until you start to. It can change quickly.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eObservationally, there are no signs of fracture in the Islanders’ room and Lambert is correct in saying the players are giving good —\u0026nbsp;if not always smart —\u0026nbsp;efforts from start to finish.

In terms of paying attention to the scouting, how things are played.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was especially displeased with the Red Storm’s play during a 16-3 Dayton run in which a five-point lead with 13:25 to play turned into an eight-point deficit with 9:33 left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a one-point game and we totally break down and don’t play it correctly,” Pitino said. “Then it’s a four-point game and we don’t play it correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s frustrating because the effort’s there, they want to win, they’re good guys.

However, they met with members of Child Protective Services. Their testimony, their observations about what questions were asked to them by CPS, and what answers they gave, might very well be germane to the investigation.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e Jurors cannot discuss testimony publicly \u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Unlike a criminal trial, which is public, grand jury proceedings are secret, and jurors and prosecutors cannot publicly discuss testimony and other matters, said Ian Weinstein, a professor in the Fordham University law school in\u0026nbsp;Manhattan. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e In New York, people subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury have immunity from prosecution for anything they say, unless they waive immunity, Klein said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e But, he said, although it’s not a crime to lie to a police officer or prosecutor outside the grand jury room, witnesses who lie before a\u0026nbsp;grand jury can be prosecuted for perjury. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e A witness who waives immunity can decline to answer questions by asserting a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Weinstein said. But someone with immunity must answer questions or risk being charged with contempt of court, the same charge for not showing up before a grand jury when subpoenaed, he said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e In addition to subpoenaing witnesses, the district attorney’s office can subpoena documents from CPS, the family court system — which in 2017 transferred custody of Thomas and his brothers from their mother, Justyna Zubko-Valva, to Valva — and other government agencies, Albertson said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e CPS and other agencies may seek to quash a subpoena, arguing that records should not be released because of privacy or other concerns, she said. The judge assigned to the grand jury would then rule whether to compel the release of the documents, Albertson said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Documents presented to grand juries are sealed and not released publicly. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Suffolk spokeswoman Marykate Guilfoyle said in an email that the county “would comply with any requests and subpoenas to the extent permitted by law,” but declined to say whether it has turned over documents or planned to do so, or whether it would challenge any subpoena. The county in the past has argued that state law makes CPS documents confidential. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The New York Office of Children and Family Services, which conducted the state investigation into Thomas’ death and has access to other records in the case, also\u0026nbsp;would comply “to the extent required by law,” spokesman Solomon Syed said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e Grand jury reports highly detailed \u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Special grand jury reports typically are highly detailed, and “there’s a sense of greater legitimacy” to their findings because they are conclusions of random citizens\u0026nbsp;who “bring a different perspective from the insiders,” such as prosecutors, Weinstein said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The Valva grand jury is the second in six years to investigate how CPS and its parent agency, the Suffolk Department of Social Services, protect children. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e An 83-page Suffolk grand jury report released in 2017 said lack of coordination among Suffolk, New York City and state child-welfare agencies helped lead to the sexual and other physical abuse of dozens of foster children. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Other previous Long Island special grand jury reports include a 180-page 2003 document that concluded that local Catholic Church officials concealed priest sexual abuse of Long Island children, a 156-page 2016 report on limousine safety following a crash that killed four women, and a 55-page 2019 document on illegal dumping. All the reports included recommendations for new laws or rules. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The district attorney requests a judge impanel a\u0026nbsp;special grand jury, and prosecutors write the final report. But the grand jury must approve the findings, Condon said. Grand juries can meet for months, usually a few days a week, he said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Tierney declined through his spokeswoman to say when the grand jury first convened and how long it is scheduled to meet. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Condon believes it will be a lengthy process. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Albertson said the grand jury may take “a very critical, very in-depth look at exactly how that agency\u0026nbsp;[CPS] functions, and how they functioned with respect to this incident.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e One result, she said, may be to recommend changes “in order to make the agency better, and to ensure that a death like this doesn't happen again.” \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2023-05-07T09:00:00Z","updatedDate":"2023-05-07T02:54:48.286Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/investigations/grand-jury-thomas-valva-case-tal8mtzz","headline":"Suffolk grand jury could bring criminal charges against CPS workers in Thomas Valva child-abuse case","teaserTitle":"Suffolk grand jury could bring criminal charges against CPS workers in Valva child-abuse case","newsLabel":"ndOnly","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","gridFilter":[],"contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.LongIsland.d","title":"Long Island","path":"/long-island","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.LongIsland.Investigations.d","title":"Investigations","path":"/long-island/investigations","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/NWIxODdlNTItODRhYS00","title":"INJURY230507","path":"/long-island/investigations/grand-jury-thomas-valva-case-tal8mtzz","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[{"headline":"David Olson","name":"David Olson","role":"Reporter","imageUrl":"https://cdn.newsday.com/image-service/version/c:OGVlNWFiZDYtNTE4ZS00:MWQ4NDRi/image.jpg","authorUrl":"/author/david-olson","authorPage":"","authorBio":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tDavid Olson covers health care.

One more sad testament? Yet another occasion for mass mourning? Further evidence of the ceaseless Dunkin’-ness of our island? No, we will not think of it that way. We will think of the almost-30 years of their lives that Frank and Angelica Nicoletta gave to the\u0026nbsp;busy bakery on Newbridge Road, and the 10 years before that in Brooklyn honing\u0026nbsp;their cannoli-making skills at a bakery they ran with Angelica’s brother. Those cannolis found their way to the tail end of countless meals at Caffe Napoli and other Little Italy landmarks. We will be grateful for Long\u0026nbsp;Island’s schools, which led the Nicolettas to flee Brooklyn in 1994 when their children were 4 and 9, and for the couple’s skill at retrofitting a butcher shop into a bakery to satisfy the needs of a clientele that grew to include Irish and German and Jewish and Hispanic patrons, each with pastry demands of their own.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“We were forced to make a little bit of everything for our customers,” Angelica Nicoletta said with a laugh just days after the bakery’s closing last week.\u0026nbsp;“Even though some of them were more like neighbors and family. Some were even personal friends. They saw my kids growing up, I saw their kids growing up. This is not going to be easy.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen again, running a bakery for decades — “a business so busy that you can’t sit down” — hasn’t been easy either. Think of all the cannoli — so many cannoli — and the cheesecakes, rainbow cookies, meltaways, marble cake loaves, lobster tails piped with whipped cream. “We are not 20 anymore,” Angelica said. (For the record, both Nicolettas are 66.) “We worked for 40 years really hard, \u003cem\u003ereally \u003c/em\u003ehard. It’s time for us to slow down.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWeeks before the bakery closed, a sign appeared in the window not unlike those that have appeared in the windows of lots of eateries of late, the one thanking “all our customers for your support over the years. It’s been an honor to be a part of your daily routines, celebrations and holidays.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut unlike similar Dear John efforts, the tone this time was not elegiac. The Nicolettas had not failed in any way. They weren’t driven out, they didn’t fall victim to rising costs or changing tastes. On the contrary, they had a very successful run. It was just time to say goodbye to this version of life. “We want to start a different chapter of our lives,” Angelica said. Nothing to be sad about.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat about the many friendships the Nicolettas forged with their customers over the years? Aren’t they doomed? Hardly. “We’re not going anywhere, at least for now. They know where to find us,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOK, but they won’t be able to find good quality pastry in the neighborhood anymore. Or will they?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe other day, just as the Nicolettas were locking up the bakery for the last time, a crestfallen regular showed up at the door. “Listen, the store is closed,” Angelica said.\u0026nbsp;“But we are selling it to someone who wants to open it up as a bakery again.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, good,” the man said, relieved. “Make sure they sell real good cannoli.”\u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2023-11-09T10:00:00Z","updatedDate":"2023-11-16T14:59:14.731Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/restaurants/angelicas-bakery-levittown-g7085ihb","headline":"Angelica's

Brook’s LaValle Stadium and the celebration was on. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe East Islip sideline erupted as players and coaches charged onto the field after a defensive battle against top-seeded Sayville. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfback Andrew Cooper scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns to give No. 2 East Islip a 17-7 win over the defending champions in the Suffolk Division III football final Friday night before a crowd of more than 2,000. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe victory snapped Sayville’s winning streak at 22 games and avenged a close loss to the Golden Flashes earlier in the season. Sayville’s most recent loss had come on the same stage when it fell to East Islip, 35-28, for the 2021 title. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEast Islip (9-2) will face Nassau Conference III champion South Side in the Long Island Class III Championship on Friday at Hofstra’s Shuart Stadium at 4:30 p.m. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will be East Islip’s fifth appearance in the Long Island Championships. Its only win came in 2007, a 35-7 victory over Lawrence. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are a football team that was at a crossroads at the midpoint of the season,” East Islip coach Sal J. Ciampi said. “I was concerned about our mental toughness and how we’d react to failure. And I found out early that we were resilient and understood that we can learn from losing and come back and win. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told them after we started 2-2 and lost at Sayville that I believed we could still be Suffolk County champions.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEast Islip lost at Sayville, 20-13, on Sept. 30. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We knew we were a good football team,” captain Sebastian Regis said. “We had to put it all together.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEast Islip reeled off seven straight wins, shutting down two of the best offensive units in the division the past two weeks, including a 17-0 victory over Westhampton in the semifinals. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Golden Flashes, who scored 33 points per game this season, were held to one score. They were without starting quarterback Jake Tripptree, who was injured in last week’s semifinal and was unable to play. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were pushing people into the backfield and disrupting the running game,” Regis said. “And our linebackers were making the plays right behind us. We expected a defensive battle and we got one.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Kalinowski’s interception at the East Islip 49 in the fourth quarter set up the go-ahead score. East Islip quarterback Thomas Costarelli found Matt McIntee for 30 yards to the Sayville 2 before Cooper scored on a 2-yard run for a 10-7 lead with nine minutes left. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEast Islip put the game away when Cooper took a screen pass behind a pancake block by Regis and went 28 yards for the final margin. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Regis has been the best player on Long Island for two years,” Ciampi said. “It’s unfortunate they didn’t have Tripptree. We were confident even if he played. We know that’s a great football program. And so are we.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEast Islip came up with the defensive stand of the season midway through the second quarter. Sayville drove to the half-foot line on a 16-yard catch by Kyle Messina. Messina was ruled to have landed just before the goal line, which set Sayville up for a first-and-goal play inside the 1. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMessina was stopped for no gain and then lost a yard on second down. Sayville then was called for two 5-yard motion penalties before sophomore quarterback Patrick Coan was sacked for a 10-yard loss by Regis. On fourth down, Coan was sacked again, this time by Charlie Heffernan and Dylan Bayer at the 24-yard line. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We weren’t giving an inch,” sophomore defensive tackle Bayer said. “That drive was the turning point in the game.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We didn’t execute there,” Sayville coach Reade Sands said. “We needed a few inches. We were doubling on Regis and Bayer and we didn’t make those blocks. They’re as good as it gets and you have to give them credit for making that stand.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the final possession of the first half, Costarelli engineered a seven-play, 47-yard march into field-goal range. His 7-yard completion on fourth down to Kalinowski for a first down and a 9-yard pass to Matt Baldino set up the opening score. Anthony Mariani drilled a 33-yard field goal as time expired for a 3-0 lead. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEast Islip carried that momentum into the third quarter and went on a 15-play, 71-yard march that stalled when Baldino came up inches short of a first down at the Sayville 4. The drive lasted 7:56. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few plays later, on third-and-13, Coan looked left and tossed a screen pass to Messina on his right, and he bolted down the home sideline for a 61-yard touchdown. Nick Watson kicked the extra point to make it 7-3 with 1:33 left in the third quarter.

The years pile up and the anniversaries fly by but those memories — as sharp and lacerating as the moment they were formed — haven't gone anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis year brings\u0026nbsp;the 60th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, and it's d\u0026eacute;j\u0026agrave;\u0026nbsp;vu all over again.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEvery decennial arrives with lots of JFK-related TV programming, so little wonder some of us still approach the day — and the TV — with a mixture of dread and anticipation. I just sat through eight hours of John F. Kennedy from one network (History's\u0026nbsp;\u0026quot;Kennedy\u0026quot;), three hours on another (Nat Geo's \u0026quot;JFK: One Day in America\u0026quot;) and 90\u0026nbsp;minutes on a streamer (Paramount+'s \u0026quot;JFK: What the Doctors Saw\u0026quot;).\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt's been an immersive, wall-to-wall, I-am-there-again experience, but all these hours notwithstanding, something is different this time — there will be so much \u003cem\u003eless\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003eon TV than any decennial that's come before.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJust three major series honoring the anniversary have been announced so far (there likely will be more). Compare that to the 50th, when at least 15\u0026nbsp;special program \u0026quot;events\u0026quot; across a dozen networks had been unveiled by this point.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere are a few reasons why. The obvious one is that a 60th lacks the symbolic or symmetric heft of a 50th. In addition, you can now get whatever you want whenever you want at that all-you-can-eat buffet known as the internet. Put \u0026quot;JFK assassination documentary\u0026quot; in your YouTube search bar and be prepared to be overwhelmed by hundreds of films, long and short, the vast majority of which have been posted during\u0026nbsp;the past decade. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe point is, if you are interested in the JFK assassination, you don't have to wait every 10\u0026nbsp;years to sate your curiosity. You don't have to wait 10\u0026nbsp;minutes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003eGENERATIONAL SHIFT\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut a more subtle shift has taken place these past 10\u0026nbsp;years, say observers — a generational one, where those old enough to remember have indeed grown older. That too will be reflected in what you're about to see on TV this month.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026quot;I'm 91\u0026nbsp;years old now,\u0026quot; says Clint Hill, at the opening of \u0026nbsp;\u0026quot;One Day In America,\u0026quot; which is based on the recollections of the \u0026quot;last surviving witnesses.\u0026quot; (Hill was assigned to Jacqueline Kennedy's Secret Service detail.) \u0026quot;There are a few of us left, but very few.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Hill is slumped in a chair, and intubated. His eyes are rheumy, his speech halting.\u0026nbsp;It's a profoundly moving image but can anyone born in the last 30\u0026nbsp;or even 40\u0026nbsp;years even begin to understand this specific emotion — much less experience it — just by looking at Hill in this twilight moment?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003eFASCINATION FADING?\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOr, for that matter, really even \u003cem\u003ecare\u003c/em\u003e?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026quot;I don't know that the Kennedy assassination is going to have the same fascination for the generations that haven't lived through it,\u0026quot; says David Nasaw, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Distinguished Professor of History at CUNY and author of the 2012 Joseph Kennedy biography, \u0026quot;The Patriarch.\u0026quot; \u0026quot;I am amazed constantly at how little smart students know about the past.\u0026quot;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNasaw, a Roslyn native who appears in History's\u0026nbsp;\u0026quot;Kennedy\u0026quot; adds\u0026nbsp;that \u0026quot;as the people who lived through this are no longer here, it will be more and more difficult to reconstruct those moments from the past to get them to pay attention to it.\u0026quot;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn Payne, executive producer of National Geographic Content, explained (via email) that this is why \u0026quot;One Day in America\u0026quot; focused on Hill and others like him: \u0026quot;There are only a handful of living witnesses left with comprehensive knowledge of what happened that day and those folks are now in their 80s and 90s.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Payne conceded that \u0026quot;after 60 years, this moment in history may be starting to hold less of a prominent memory, especially for younger generations who did not experience it.\u0026quot; That \u0026quot;partly\u0026quot; explains why there is less on TV marking this 60th, she says.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It's easy to see that a profound shift, and a dissociative one, has taken place since the 50th anniversary. To most people born in (say) the early 1950s, memories of that day haven't aged a bit but \u003cem\u003ethey\u003c/em\u003e certainly have. They're in their 70s now, while the earliest boomers (born 1946) are pushing 80.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003eJFK'S LEGACY IS STILL POWERFUL\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCould anyone born after Nov. 22, 1963, have the same emotional investment in yet one more TV documentary about a long-ago tragedy as they do?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLarry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, and author of 2013's \u0026quot;The Kennedy Half-Century: The Presidency, Assassination, and Lasting Legacy of John F.

The Coen Brothers long ago established a template most easily defined as a series of opposites — good versus evil, or innocence versus depravity. Those tend to shape a story that unfolds with primal force under that endless sky. For the Coens as for Hawley, violence is as American as apple pie. It's also convulsive and shocking. If anything, Hawley has over-adjusted for that part of the formula this season.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOtherwise, it's back to basics for the fifth. The universe is random and gives no thought to the fates of mice or Minnesotans. Good people die just as easily as bad ones, while those who survive are as hard as the land in January.

They can't fathom the motives of those who keep dark secrets, and must work assiduously to uncover them. That's the other thing about \u0026quot;Fargo\u0026quot; characters. Along with Minnesota-nice, they're Minnesota-stubborn.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen, shadowing all of these mortals, is a\u0026nbsp;malevolent force that's both unknowable and unstoppable. That's a unique Hawley touch, and an effective one. Recall the season when aliens from outer space may (or maybe not) came to Bemidji. This season the mystery is supernatural, and revealed in flashback.

However, his popularity came late in life. Although he built a steady following on the late-night TV circuit, his career didn’t fully pop until he dropped his 2017 Netflix special, “Live from Seattle.” His bits like \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7SwjdMIteg\"\u003e“Rice Is Rice”\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;and “My Brother-in-Law Dre” went viral garnering millions of views on YouTube, which propelled his act into\u0026nbsp;arenas.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBefore bringing his world tour to UBS Arena at Belmont Park in Elmont\u0026nbsp;on Nov. 24, Koy spoke with Newsday\u0026nbsp;about falling in love with stand-up, finding his comedic voice and taking on an arena-size crowd.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen and how did you first get exposed to stand-up comedy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI was always a funny kid in school and my friend would call me a comedian, but I had no idea what that was. When I was 9, he played me his dad’s Richard Pryor tape and I could not stop listening to it. By 12, I saw Eddie Murphy’s “Delirious” and I got to physically see what a stand-up comedian did and I knew that’s what I’m supposed to be for the rest of my life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen was your first time on stage?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI was right out of high school. I entered this talent contest called “Starmania” at a local bar. I wasn’t even old enough to be there. I had to pencil in a fake mustache on my face. I bombed so bad. This guy, who won the contest doing a Lionel Richie impersonation, told me, “Yeah man, you didn’t do good, but you were fun to watch. You have good stage presence.” If it wasn’t for him, I probably would have quit.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen did it click for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt took me three years to figure it out and understand how to be conversational and natural. I realized that the funny guy that I am when I’m at lunch with my friends can be the same guy on stage.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the evolution of your humor?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy 2005, I started hitting my stride at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. My son was just born and I’d talk about my day in more of a storyteller style fashion rather than direct jokes. I began\u0026nbsp;gathering material from my home life. When you are a new parent, you are stressed out and there’s nothing more stress relieving\u0026nbsp;than laughter. People could relate to what I was going through and that was comforting because I felt like I wasn’t alone. That’s what I love about comedy. You don’t need to be a certain ethnicity or religion to relate because we are all the same.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou rolled the dice on your career by shooting a comedy special, 'Live from Seattle,' and selling it to Netflix after getting passed over. Was that a nerve-wracking moment?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes! I had been in the game for 26 years and I was willing to bet everything I had to prove that I was right. It was the biggest gamble of my life, but I’m glad I did it. Even if Netflix didn’t buy it, I was going to put it on YouTube anyway. But initially when they passed, I was so hurt that I felt invisible. My numbers were nothing to them. Meanwhile I was selling out hundreds of shows at the Improv breaking records. To not be recognized was heartbreaking and caused me to be depressed. I truly felt like quitting. But I saw my numbers and that’s why I bet on myself. To be clear, the people that gave me my current deal at Netflix are not from the regime that passed on me. That was the old school mentality.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour\u0026nbsp;mom is an incredible character in your work. How did you start incorporating her into your material?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOne Christmas I bought my son a Wii gaming system and my mom started playing with him. All of a sudden, she’s talking smack to this 5-year-old and I was getting a kick out of it. I went on stage the next night and told the story of how she looked at him saying, “Game Over!” after she beat him in Wii tennis. The crowd died laughing and I realized this is the way to introduce my Filipino mom into my comedy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou are currently performing at an arena level.

It’s like mental Olympics. Imagine playing 25 comedy clubs at the same time. Plus, there’s so many different people and attitudes to juggle. You have to cut excess fat on every routine and get to the punchlines quicker. Your pace has to be fast but not too fast. It’s a fine balance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you keep up this high level of hilarity?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou have to be your genuine self and be vulnerable on stage. You can’t be afraid or question the thoughts in your head because that’s where the real laughter comes from. Plus, I don’t take breaks, I’m constantly writing. I have to keep this engine running or I’m going to lose everything.\u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2023-11-16T10:00:00Z","updatedDate":"2023-11-16T19:28:06.685Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/celebrities/jo-koy-comedy-ubs-arena-iyq96q4t","headline":"Jo Koy brings the funny to UBS Arena","teaserTitle":"Jo Koy brings the funny to UBS Arena","newsLabel":"none","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","gridFilter":[],"contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Entertainment.d","title":"Entertainment","path":"/entertainment","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Entertainment.Celebrities.d","title":"Celebrities","path":"/entertainment/celebrities","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/cdbba922-5551-4542-9252-c475fbb968a8","title":"ETKOY231119","path":"/entertainment/celebrities/jo-koy-comedy-ubs-arena-iyq96q4t","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[{"headline":"David J.
