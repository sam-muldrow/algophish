An agent can be an excellent resource for your search. For example, if you’re interested in an amenity-rich high-rise apartment, an agent can help you find one and show you condos with a similar lifestyle where you might rent from an individual owner. An agent can assist you with single-family home rental options, town houses, and every style of apartment that’s available where you want to live. As you describe the neighborhood amenities you prefer, such as parks, pools, bike lanes or restaurants, your agent can make suggestions of a variety of places that you might not know about which could be appealing.","guide.landing.renting.yourSearch.howEarly.title":"How early should I start my search?","guide.landing.renting.yourSearch.howEarly.description":"A serious search should start about one month before you sign a lease, but if you’re in the exploratory stage and need to know more about what’s available in your price range, it’s smart to start a few months ahead. You can always start online at KW.com to get an idea of rentals in different areas and then contact an agent when you’re a couple of months away from your target moving date.","guide.landing.renting.yourSearch.whatShould.title":"What should I consider with my search?","guide.landing.renting.yourSearch.whatShould.description":"For most people, their budget and the location are the most important considerations when looking for a home to rent. If you have children, the schools may influence where you want to look. If you have pets, you’ll need to look for a pet-friendly rental. Next, make a list of your priorities for the location and the rental itself. For example, you may care most about parking, laundry equipment in your apartment or in the building, the size of the apartment, amenities such as a pool or a gym, and whether the building is pet-friendly or has any pet restrictions. Your real estate agent can help you discuss your priorities. If you’re renting with someone else, your agent can work to find the overlap in your list of needs and wants and find ways to compromise.","guide.landing.renting.yourSearch.howDoIView.title":"How do I view properties in person? Why is this important?","guide.landing.renting.yourSearch.howDoIView.description":"Once you’ve narrowed down your list to a few possibilities that you like, you or your agent can call to make sure the places are available and to schedule an appointment. While you can eliminate some places and find others you like in your online search, your can’t easily know about important things such as how noisy a place may be or how much natural light it gets unless you go in person. Visiting a property can give you a better idea of the neighborhood and allows you to check personally on how well your phone works, whether the appliances work, if your furniture will fit, and if there is enough storage. Be sure to check out the condition of the common areas as well as your prospective home for signs of neglect or good maintenance. Bring your list of needs and wants with you so you don’t forget to check for those items while you’re touring a property. Your agent can be a valuable companion and adviser when visiting properties to point out features that are appealing or a red flag.","guide.landing.renting.searchingInsurance.title":"Searching for renters insurance","guide.landing.renting.searchingInsurance.description":"While you’re searching for a place to live, you should also line up renters insurance for your future home. Comparison shopping can yield a good rate and help you decide how much coverage you need.","guide.landing.renting.searchingInsurance.whatIs.title":"What is renters insurance?","guide.landing.renting.searchingInsurance.whatIs.description":"Renters insurance is an insurance policy that renters buy for themselves to provide protection for their belongings in case of something happening such as a fire, a burst pipe, a storm, or a theft. These policies also provide liability protection in case someone gets hurt at your home. A renters policy even covers your things when they’re in your car or on vacation with you. Just like car insurance covers your car and you in an accident, renters insurance provides protection for you at home.","guide.landing.renting.searchingInsurance.why.title":"Why do I need it?","guide.landing.renting.searchingInsurance.why.description":"Your landlord’s insurance will cover necessary home repairs but won’t cover the costs of replacing your items if they’re damaged in a fire or stolen. Some landlords require their tenants have a renters insurance policy, because the policy provides extra insurance for the renter in case of an accident or damages to their apartment or their neighbor’s apartment. Renters insurance typically costs from $15 to $30 per month, an inexpensive way to protect your valuable possessions and to protect your assets in case something happens at your home to injure someone or damage their property. Some renters policies even cover a hotel stay if you have to move out while your home is repaired.","guide.landing.renting.termsAndPolicies.title":"Asking the questions, understanding terms and policies","guide.landing.renting.termsAndPolicies.description":"An important part of your search is making sure you understand the rules and policies of your potential landlord.
