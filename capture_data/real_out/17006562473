				In this video, we will show you how to play rummy. Let us first start with the scoring values of each card in the pack.
				 <p>The Ace, King, Queen and Jack are known as face cards and are worth 10 points each, and the numbered cards are scored according to their face value.</p>
				  <p>Each player is dealt thirteen cards, and one is supposed to make sets or sequences of 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit. </p>
				  <p>A pure sequence is made of consecutive cards of the same suit. </p>
				  <p>An impure sequence can have a joker or a wild card to denote a missing card in the sequence. Also, a group of three cards of the same value but different suits, known as a set, can also be counted as an impure sequence.</p>
				  <p>Once players are dealt 13 cards each, the remaining cards are piled up, and a card from the pile is designated as a joker.</p>
				  <p>During the game, one discards a card and picks another from the pile, keeping the hand at 13. One can pick up from the discarded pile too. </p>
				  <p>Remember to sort the cards according to their suits as it makes for better gameplay and makes it easier to sort out what to keep or discard.</p>
				  <p>The person who forms a full set of sequences first, including a mandated pure sequence, can declare the game as finished. The un-sequenced cards of the opponent are counted for scoring.</p>
				  <p><strong>Tips </strong></p>
				  <ul class="pl-15">
					  <li>The game's basic strategy is to know which card to keep or discard.</li>
					  <li>Unused high-value cards should be discarded fast.</li>
					  <li>If a joker is declared as the wild card joker, then an ace can also be used as a joker in sequences.</li>
					  <li>Drop out of the game; if you have got a weak hand, you will not lose many points.</li>
				  </ul>

				Rummy is a popular card game played by millions of Indians, who are always eager to score a win. The game has different variants, but the 13 card game is much loved in India. The game's primary objective is to be the fastest in making pure and impure sequences. Players can pick and discard a card from a pile to form these sequences. Here are some simple tricks and tips for setting you ahead of the ‘pack.’ Best tips to win a rummy game:
				  <ul class="pl-15">
					  <li>Get a pure sequence: A pure sequence is a consecutive set of cards of the same suit and is a game requirement. Hence, getting it quickly is essential. Do not keep on holding on to cards for longer than necessary in the hopes of making a sequence. If you have a 3H, 5H, and 6H and get a 7H, then discard 3.</li>
					  <li>Know your opponent: Keep track of what cards your opponent discards and picks. It gives you an insight into what cards they hold and their pattern of play.</li>
					  <li>Discard high-value cards: Some people keep high-value cards, hoping to use them later in a sequence, but that is a wrong move as they eat away into your score if your opponent declares.</li>
					  <li>Sort option: use the option to set out your cards more effectively. You can do it according to the  suits. Alternate with a different set of colors to avoid confusion.</li>
					  <li>Bluff your opponent by holding onto two-similar cards, and once a sequence is finished, discard the unused ones. Also, do some fishing, and pick up a card you know the opponent needs; this will confuse your opponents.</li>
					  <li>Drop cards that are nearer to the chosen Joker. The reason is that it prevents the opponent from using the Joker effectively. For example, if the Joker is 5 of diamonds, then dropping a 4 of a similar suit ensures that the other player finds it difficult to use the Joker.</li>
					  <li>Dropping from the game: There are penalties for dropping from an online rummy game, but it is still prudent to use this option in specific scenarios. When you have a weak hand, consider it, or when you find it difficult to form a sequence, use the option of a middle drop (missing after one move).</li>
					  <li>Middle cards advantage: Middle cards are the most versatile and help make the maximum number of combinations. Retain your middle cards for longer. The middle cards can be used extensively hence they are instrumental in helping you win</li>
					  <li>Practice makes perfect: Use the practice games offered by the platform to learn the game and hone your skills.</li>
					  <li>Jokers and how to use them: Use the Joker to complete a sequence set. Make use of a joker when making a higher points sequence. Avoid using it in a natural sequence.</li>
				  </ul>
				  <p><strong>Please note: These are just tips to help you play better but are no guarantee of a win.</strong></p>

I have won a few tournaments before. The huge prize money encouraged me to continue the game. The moment I won the 1st prize was a life changing moment! I have played rummy in different sites. But, RummyCircle seems to be the best of all in every aspect. Right from the appearance of the game window, tournament structure and prize money. Finally, the withdrawals are awesome for DIAMOND, PLATINUM & PLATINUM ELITE clubs. The winning amount gets credited to your account within seconds.",
