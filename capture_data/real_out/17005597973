                               <p>You will be entitled to a full refund for any in-app items purchased in the two (2) month period leading up to the Sunset Date. All refund requests must be made through the relevant app store or by contacting us <span>here.</span> Please note, you only have thirty (30) days after the Sunset Date of a game to make your claim, otherwise you will lose your entitlement to any refund.

                               <p>Some of our games let you buy Virtual Items. You can recognise these games because they have an option to purchase Virtual Items, either in an in-game shop or, in the case of Coins, usually at the top of the specific game playing window. Games may allow you to buy different amounts of Virtual Items and may have temporary offers or sales for Virtual Item purchases.</p>
                               <p>&nbsp;</p>
                               <p>Please note that when purchasing Virtual Items through one of our games, which you will have downloaded from an app store, there may be additional terms and conditions which apply. You may be asked to agree to the app store provider's own terms and conditions, which will apply in addition to these Virtual Items Terms. We suggest you read app store terms carefully and follow the process provided by the relevant app store.</p>
                               <p>&nbsp;</p>
                               <p>We do not permit third parties to give or sell Coins and other Virtual Items outside of our games. Accordingly, as a condition to playing our games, you agree not to receive, purchase and/or use Coins or Virtual Items from such third parties. Any unauthorised Coins or Virtual Items that you purchase are subject to forfeiture at any time.</p>

                                   <li>Gamebasics does not process payments. A third-party payment provider or the app store itself (such as Apple or Google Play Store) handles payments. If you have any issues or problems with payment for a Virtual Item, you should therefore contact the third-party payment provider or the app store directly.</li>

                               <p>Generally, no. The app and website accounts are not always linked, but in some cases<strong>, </strong>such as for Online Soccer Manager the Coin wallets are linked. However, for some games there is no link, and if you purchase Virtual Items through one platform account, they will not appear in other platform accounts you may have with us.</p>

                               <p>You can spend your Coins in order to acquire other Virtual Items within the game within which you purchased the Coins. When you use Coins to acquire another Virtual Item within a game, the relevant amount of Coins will automatically be deducted from your account that is connected with that game.</p>
                               <p>&nbsp;</p>
                               <p>Other than Coins, the availability, nature and duration of any Virtual Items may vary from time to time. Some Virtual Items may only be used a limited number of times or only whilst you satisfy certain conditions.</p>

                               <p>We can at any time, without notifying you, vary the scope, variety and type of Virtual Items.
