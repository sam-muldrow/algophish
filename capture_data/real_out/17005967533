<p>Since <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/11/more_altman_openai">last I wrote about</a> the ongoing leadership battle at OpenAI:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>OpenAI named a <em>new</em> interim CEO, Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear. (<a href="https://twitter.com/rowancheung/status/1726473420299534491">Shear is an AI worrier</a>, who has advocated drastically “slowing down”, <a href="https://twitter.com/eshear/status/1703178063306203397">writing</a> “If we’re at a speed of 10 right now, a pause is reducing to 0. I think we should aim for a 1-2 instead.”) OpenAI CTO Mira Murati was CEO for about two days.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1726509045803336122">Satya Nadella announced very late Sunday night</a>, “And we’re extremely excited to share the news that Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, together with colleagues, will be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team. We look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources needed for their success.”</p></li>
<li><p>About 700 OpenAI employees, out of a total of 770, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/20/hundreds-of-openai-employees-threaten-to-follow-altman-to-microsoft-unless-board-resigns-reports-say.html">signed an open letter demanding the OpenAI board resign</a>, and threatening to quit to join Altman at Microsoft if they don’t. Among the signees: Mira Murati (which might explain why she’s no longer interim CEO) and chief scientist and board member Ilya Sutskever.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028">Sutskever posted on Twitter/X</a>: “I deeply regret my participation in the board’s actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we’ve built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company.”</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23969586/sam-altman-plotting-return-open-ai-microsoft">Alex Heath and Nilay Patel report for The Verge</a> that Altman and Brockman might still return to OpenAI.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/20/microsoft-ceo-nadella-says-openai-governance-needs-to-change-no-matter-where-altman-ends-up.html">Nadella appeared on CNBC</a> and admitted that Altman and Brockman were not officially signed as Microsoft employees yet, and when asked who would be OpenAI’s CEO tomorrow, laughed, because he didn’t know.</p></li>

<h6 class="dateline">Saturday, 18 November 2023</h6>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/technology/sam-altman-open-ai.html">Kevin Roose, reporting for The New York Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An all-hands meeting for OpenAI employees on Friday afternoon 
didn’t reveal much more. Ilya Sutskever, the company’s chief 
scientist and a member of its board, defended the ouster, 
according to a person briefed on his remarks. He dismissed 
employees’ suggestions that pushing Mr. Altman out amounted to a 
“hostile takeover” and claimed it was necessary to protect 
OpenAI’s mission of making artificial intelligence beneficial to 
humanity, the person said. </p>

<p>Mr. Altman appears to have been blindsided, too. He recorded an 
interview for the podcast I co-host, “Hard Fork,” on Wednesday, 
two days before his firing. During our chat, he betrayed no hint 
that anything was amiss, and he talked at length about the success 
of ChatGPT, his plans for OpenAI and his views on A.I.’s future. </p>

<p>Mr. Altman stayed mum about the precise circumstances of his 
departure on Friday. But Greg Brockman — OpenAI’s co-founder
and president, who quit on Friday in solidarity with Mr.
Altman — <a href="https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1725736242137182594">released a statement</a> saying that both of them were 
“shocked and saddened by what the board did today.” Mr. Altman was 
asked to join a video meeting with the board at noon on Friday and 
was immediately fired, Mr. Brockman said. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kara Swisher was all over the story last night, <a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1725678898388553901">writing on Twitter/X</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sources tell me that the profit direction of the company under 
Altman and the speed of development, which could be seen as too 
risky, and the nonprofit side dedicated to more safety and caution 
were at odds. One person on the Sam side called it a “coup,” while 
another said it was the the right move. [...] </p>

<p>More: The board members who voted against Altman felt he was 
manipulative and headstrong and wanted to do what he wanted to do. 
That sounds like a typical SV CEO to me, but this might not be a 
typical SV company. They certainly have a lot of explaining to do. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1725736242137182594">According to Brockman</a> — who until he quit in protest of Altman’s firing was chairman of the OpenAI board — he didn’t find out until just 5 minutes before Altman was sacked. I’ve never once heard of a corporate board firing the company’s CEO behind the back of the chairman of the board.</p>

<p>It really does look more and more like a deep philosophical fissure inside OpenAI, between those led by Sutskever (and, obviously, a majority of the board) advocating a cautious slow and genuinely non-profit-driven approach, and Altman/Brockman’s “let’s move fast, change the world, and make a lot of money” side. Sutskever and the OpenAI board seemingly see Altman/Brockman as reckless swashbucklers; Altman and Brockman, I suspect, see Sutskever and his side as a bunch of ninnies.</p>

<p>A simple way to look at it is to read <a href="https://openai.com/charter">OpenAI’s charter</a>, “the principles we use to execute on OpenAI’s mission”. It’s a mere 423 words, and very plainly written. It doesn’t sound anything at all like the company Altman has been running. The board, it appears, believes in the charter. How in the world it took them until now to realize Altman was leading OpenAI in directions completely contrary to their charter is beyond me.</p>

<p>It’s like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">the police chief in <em>Casablanca</em> being “shocked — shocked!”</a> to find out that gambling was taking place in a casino <em>where he played</em>.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘More on Sam Altman’s Ouster From OpenAI’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/11/more_altman_openai">&#9733;</a></p>

<h6 class="dateline">Saturday, 18 November 2023</h6>

<p>Monica Chin, reporting for The Verge last month, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23930366/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-processor-availability-release-date">Qualcomm Claims Its Snapdragon X Elite Processor Will Beat Apple, Intel, and AMD</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Qualcomm has <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/10/qualcomm-unleashes-snapdragon-x-elite--the-ai-super-charged-plat">announced its new Snapdragon X Elite platform</a>, 
which looks to be its most powerful computing processor to date. 
The chips (including the new Qualcomm Oryon, announced today) are 
built on a 4nm process and include 136GB/s of memory bandwidth. 
PCs are expected to ship in mid-2024. [...] </p>

<p>Oh, Qualcomm also claims that its chip will deliver “50% faster 
peak multi-thread performance” than Apple’s M2 chip. This is just 
a funny claim; the X Elite has 50 percent more cores than the M2 
and sucks down much more power, so of course it is going to do 
better on Geekbench at “peak multi-thread performance.” That’s 
like a professional sprinter bragging about winning the 100-meter 
dash against a bunch of marathon champions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This news is so old that <a href="https://www.threads.net/@monicawchin/post/CzT0V8Fuj-h">Chin is no longer on the staff at The Verge</a> (which I think explains why she didn’t write either of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23944344/apple-macbook-pro-14-2023-review-m3-specs-battery-ports">their</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23949207/apple-macbook-pro-16-m3-max-review-price-specs">reviews</a> for the new M3 MacBook Pros), but I’m cleaning up old tabs and wanted to comment on this.</p>

<p>It’s nonsense. Chips that aren’t slated to appear in any actual laptops until “mid-2024” are being compared to the M2, which Apple debuted with the MacBook Air in June 2022. So even if Qualcomm’s performance claims are true <em>and</em> PCs based on their chips ship on schedule, they’re comparing against a chip that Apple debuted two entire years earlier.</p>

<p>Plus they’re only comparing multi-core performance against the base M2. And they’re not really comparing multi-core performance overall but “peak” performance, however it is they define that. And the fact that they <em>only</em> mention multi-core performance strongly suggests that they’re slower than the M2 at single-core performance, which for most consumer/prosumer use cases is more important.</p>

<p>And: No one in the PC world seems to care about ARM chips, at least for laptops. Microsoft made a go of it with their Surface line and largely gave up. My understanding is that fewer than 1 percent of PC sales today are ARM-based machines. If Microsoft wasn’t willing to optimize Windows to make it ARM-first, or even treat ARM as an equal to x86, when they themselves were trying to make ARM-based Windows laptops a thing, why would they do it now?</p>

<p>If Mac hardware and MacOS were made by separate companies, and the MacOS software company licensed their OS to other OEMs, I really don’t think Apple silicon hardware would have happened. The seemingly too-good-to-be-true performance of Apple silicon Macs is the result of the silicon being designed for the software and the software being optimized and at very low levels designed for the silicon. Qualcomm isn’t going to get that from Microsoft with Windows.</p>

<p>Qualcomm’s X Elite platform may well beat Intel and AMD, but I’m not sure that will matter in the PC world unless Microsoft truly goes all-in on ARM with Windows. Which I don’t see happening. But the idea that they’re even vaguely catching up to Apple silicon is laughable, and it’s frustrating that so much of the tech press took anything Qualcomm claimed about relative performance against Apple silicon seriously.</p>

<p>We know for a fact that their Snapdragon chips for phones have always lagged years behind Apple’s A-series chips in both sheer performance and performance-per-watt, with no sign that they’re catching up. So how in the world would their ARM chips for PCs beat Apple’s M-series chips?</p>

<p>And, yes, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/16/qualcomm-m-series-competitive-cpus">I predicted this back in November 2021, when Qualcomm claimed they’d be shipping “M-series competitive” chips for PCs by 2023</a>. Qualcomm <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1382740/qualcomm-dubs-nuvia-cpu-oryon-on-track-for-2023.html">claimed to still be on track to ship in 2023</a> just one year ago, so I wouldn’t hold my breath for “mid-2024” either.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Qualcomm’s Awkward Boasting Regarding Its Forthcoming X Elite Platform’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/11/qualcomm_awkward_boasting">&#9733;</a></p>

<p>Ina Fried, reporting for Axios:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is pausing all advertising on X, the Elon Musk-owned social 
network, sources tell Axios. The move follows Musk’s endorsement 
of antisemitic conspiracy theories as well as Apple ads reportedly 
being placed alongside far-right content. Apple has been a major 
advertiser on the social media site and its pause follows a 
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/17/x-elon-musk-ibm-amazon-apple-ads-antisemitic">similar move by IBM</a>. </p>

<p>Musk faced backlash for <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/16/elon-musk-antisemitic-claim-tesla-shares">endorsing an antisemitic post</a> 
Wednesday, as 164 Jewish rabbis and activists <a href="https://www.xouthate.org/">upped their 
call</a> to Apple, Google, Amazon and Disney to stop 
advertising on X, and for Apple and Google to remove it from their 
platforms. </p>

<p>The left-leaning nonprofit Media Matters for America published 
<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/musk-endorses-antisemitic-conspiracy-theory-x-has-been-placing-ads-apple-bravo-ibm-oracle">a report</a> Thursday that highlighted Apple, IBM, 
Amazon and Oracle as among those whose ads were shown next to 
far-right posts. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s fair, in some sense, to describe Media Matters for America as “left-leaning”, but they have a decades-long reputation for accuracy. They don’t publish hit pieces that are later proven to have been manipulated. There’s no reason to doubt <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/musk-endorses-antisemitic-conspiracy-theory-x-has-been-placing-ads-apple-bravo-ibm-oracle">their report or the screenshots it contained</a> — especially if, like me, you still do check in on Twitter. This is what it’s like over there now.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/17/tech/lionsgate-suspends-advertising-x-musk/index.html">Disney and Warner Bros Discovery have suspended advertising on Twitter/X too</a>.</p>

<dd>
<p>OpenAI press release:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The board of directors of OpenAI, Inc., the 501(c)(3) that acts as 
the overall governing body for all OpenAI activities, today 
announced that Sam Altman will depart as CEO and leave the board 
of directors. Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer, 
will serve as interim CEO, effective immediately. [...] </p>

<p>Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by 
the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in 
his communications with the board, hindering its ability to 
exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence 
in his ability to continue leading OpenAI. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By corporate board standards, that statement is absolutely <a href="https://www.threads.net/@pkafka/post/CzwsxEYvnVu">scathing</a>. There’s widespread speculation some sort of scandal must be at the heart of this, but no word yet what.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1725631621511184771">Altman, on Twitter/X</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me 
personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i 
loved working with such talented people. </p>

<p>will have more to say about what’s next later. </p>

<p>🫡 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That all-lowercase style is consistent for Altman’s personal tweets, but man does it look extra fucking silly in a post like this one.</p>

<p>Just last week <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk">Altman hosted OpenAI’s first DevDay keynote</a> (where <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/07/openai-devday-keynote">he did great</a>), and Cade Metz reports for The New York Times, as late as <em>yesterday</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/technology/openai-sam-altman-ousted.html">Altman was still publicly representing OpenAI</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Thursday evening, Mr. Altman appeared at an event in Oakland, 
Calif., where he discussed the future of art and artists now that 
artificial intelligence can generate images, videos, sounds and 
other forms of art on its own. Giving no indication that he was 
leaving OpenAI, he repeatedly said he and the company would 
continue to work alongside artists and help to ensure their future 
would be bright. </p>

<p>Earlier in the day, he appeared at the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation CEO Summit in San Francisco with Laurene Powell Jobs, 
who is the founder and president of the Emerson Collective, and 
executives from Meta and Google. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Altman also <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1722766374588830101">just publicly dunked on Elon Musk</a>. I’m sure Musk will just let it slide.)</p>

<p>Lastly, Altman, despite being credited as a co-founder, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sam-altman-says-doesn-t-204324251.html">has no equity in OpenAI</a>. Meta, for example, <a href="https://www.businessthink.unsw.edu.au/articles/mark-zuckerberg-Meta-shareholders">can’t fire Zuckerberg</a> — <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/6/13/15788892/alphabet-shareholder-proposals-fair-shares-counted-equally-no-supervote">same deal for Google with Larry Page and Sergey Brin</a> — but OpenAI could sack Altman with a board vote because he owns <em>none</em> of it, much less a controlling interest.</p>

<a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/breaking-apple-will-support-rcs-in-2024">Apple Announces Intention to Support RCS Messages ‘Next Year’</a>&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Announces Intention to Support RCS Messages ‘Next Year’’" href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/16/apple-rcs">&#9733;</a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Lance Ulanoff, reporting for TechRadar:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RCS or Rich Communication Services, a communications standard 
developed by the GSM Association and adopted by much of the 
Android ecosystem, is designed to universally elevate messaging 
communication across mobile devices. Even though Apple has been 
working with the group, it has until this moment steadfastly 
refused to add RCS support to iPhones. Now, however, Apple is 
changing its tune. </p>

<p>“Later next year, we will be adding support for RCS Universal 
Profile, the standard as currently published by the GSM 
Association. We believe the RCS Universal Profile will offer a 
better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS. 
This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the 
best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users,” said 
an Apple spokesperson. [...] </p>

<p>When RCS does arrive on your best iPhone, though, it means the end 
of the “green bubble shame” for your best Android phone-owning 
friends, family, and coworkers. They’ll be able to send and 
receive high-resolution photos and videos from their phones to 
your iPhone. Group messaging could become platform agnostic. And 
they’ll be able to share their location with you through 
RCS-supported messaging. </p>

<p>There is, naturally, a wrinkle here. The RCS standard still 
doesn’t support end-to-end encryption. Apple, which has offered 
encrypted messaging for over a decade, is kind of a stickler about 
security. Apple says it won’t be supporting any proprietary 
extensions that seek to add encryption on top of RCS and hopes, 
instead, to work with the GSM Association to add encryption to the 
standard. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Color me surprised by Apple’s change of heart here. Also color me utterly <em>un</em>surprised that Apple has no intention to support Google’s proprietary extensions to RCS that allow for E2EE. It’s a disgrace, in my opinion, that E2EE wasn’t a foundational part of the RCS spec from the start, but if Apple is going to support RCS, they should support RCS by-the-spec, not Google’s proprietary version.</p>

<p>I suspect that in practical terms, this might have almost no discernible effect on the user experience. RCS messages are not going to be blue — <s>they’re either going to stay green, just like SMS/MMS messages, or perhaps Apple will add a new color (purple?) for RCS</s>. I suspect RCS messages will just remain green though, and it’ll be treated as what it is: the next generation of phone-carrier-based messaging. I think any initial coverage today framing this as the end of the green/blue disparity is totally wrong. It’s just about making green messages higher quality and more reliable. <strong>Update:</strong> I confirmed with Apple today that RCS messages will be green, just like SMS and MMS messages.</p>

<p>The best part of the experience, for users, is that RCS supports higher-resolution photos and videos. The worst part is that it’s not encrypted, and Apple caving and deciding to support it will expand, rather than contract, the amount of messaging that is not E2EE. And what’s the plan for when (if?) E2EE gets added to the official RCS spec? Will Apple then <em>drop</em> support for non-encrypted RCS messages? Or add some sort of indicator — a badge or different message color — to indicate which messages are truly encrypted and which are not?</p>

<p>There were also reports from just last year that RCS was being abused to send large amounts of spam in India — see reports here from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/18/23121150/google-messages-india-rcs-ads">The Verge</a> and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/05/17/google-messages-rcs-ads-india/">9to5Google</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And that raises a real question. How does antitrust handle a situation where the company that is so dominant is in that position because is legitimately offers a better product by a wide margin.</p>

<p>I would love to see more real competition in the search space. Bing and DuckDuckGo continue to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/08/16/techdirt-has-again-been-removed-from-bing-and-mostly-duckduckgo/">just not cut it</a>. I’m intrigued by startups like Kagi (which I’ve been using, and which actually seems pretty good), but it’s not clear how antitrust helps companies like that get a wider audience.</p>

<p>I’m increasingly coming to the belief that we’ve spent way too many years equating <em>antitrust</em> with <em>increased competition</em>, when it’s one of the least effective mechanisms for enabling greater competition. The situation with Mozilla and Firefox seems to just put an exclamation point on that. If the DOJ wins this lawsuit, what will it actually do to help get more competition on the market? More competition that is actually good and that people want?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it’s pretty clear that Apple and Google’s TAC deal is the result of fair competition, not an obstacle to it. The iPhone is by far the best mobile platform in the world, and Google search the best search engine (or at least the best free one — Kagi is so good I’d say it gives Google a run for money straight up on results quality). Apple is beset on all sides by competitors to the iPhone — including Google itself! Google has always had competition in search. I for one really do think Google has let its search results quality decline, but even so, they’re still undeniably the best among the mainstream search engines.</p>

<p>So of course there’s some sort of lucrative — and mutually beneficial — deal between Apple and Google to keep Google the default for search in Safari.</p>

<h6 class="dateline">Friday, 10 November 2023</h6>

<p>Yesterday <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-beta-2-spatial-video">Apple released developer beta 2 of iOS 17.2</a>, the first version of iOS to include support for capturing spatial video with iPhone 15 Pro models. Today came the public beta, enabling the same feature. Apple invited me to New York yesterday, not merely to preview capturing spatial video using an iPhone, but to experience watching those spatial videos using a Vision Pro.</p>

<p>The experience was, like my first Vision Pro demo back at WWDC in June, astonishing.</p>

<h2>Capturing Spatial Video on an iPhone</h2>

<p>Shooting spatial video on an iPhone 15 Pro is easy. The feature is — for now at least — disabled by default, and can be enabled in Settings → Camera → Formats. The option is labeled “Spatial Video for Apple Vision Pro”, which is apt, because (again, for now at least) spatial video only looks different from non-spatial video when playing it back on Vision Pro. When viewed on any other device it just looks like a regular flat video.</p>

<p>Once enabled, you can toggle spatial video capture in the Camera app whenever you’re in the regular Video mode. It’s very much akin to the toggle for Live Photos when taking still photos, or the Action mode toggle for video — not a separate mode in the main horizontal mode switcher in Camera, but a toggle button in the main Video mode.</p>

<p>When capturing spatial video, you have no choice regarding resolution, frame rate, or file format. All spatial video is captured at 1080p, 30 fps, in the HEVC file format.<sup id="fnr1-2023-11-10"><a href="#fn1-2023-11-10">1</a></sup> You also need to hold the phone horizontally, to put the two capturing lenses on the same plane. The iPhone uses the main (1×) and ultra wide (0.5×) lenses for capture when shooting spatial video, and in fact, Apple changed the arrangement of the three lenses on the iPhone 15 Pro in part to support this feature. (On previous iPhone Pro models, when held horizontally, the ultra wide camera was on the bottom, and the main and telephoto lenses were next to each other on the top.)</p>

<p>I believe resolution is limited to 1080p because to get an image from the ultra wide 0.5× camera that is the equivalent field of view as from the main 1× camera, it needs to crop the ultra wide image significantly. The ultra wide camera has a mere 12 MP sensor, so there just aren’t enough pixels to crop a 1× equivalent field of view from the center of the sensor and get a 4K image.</p>

<p>There are two downsides to shooting spatial video with your iPhone. First, the aforementioned 1080p resolution and 30 fps frame rate. I’ve been shooting 4K video by default for years, because why not? I wish we could capture spatial video at 4K, but alas, not yet. The second downside to shooting spatial video is that it effectively doubles the file size compared to non-spatial 1080p, for the obvious reason that each spatial video contains two 1080p video streams. That file-size doubling is a small price to pay — the videos are still smaller than non-spatial 4K 30 fps video.<sup id="fnr2-2023-11-10"><a href="#fn2-2023-11-10">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Really, it’s just no big deal to capture spatial video on your iPhone. If the toggle button is off, you capture regular video with all the regular options for resolution (720p/1080p/4K) and frame rates (24/30/60). If the toggle for spatial video is on — and when on it’s yellow, impossible to miss — you lose those choices but it just looks like capturing a regular video. And when you play it back, or share it with others who are viewing it on regular devices like their phones or computers, it just looks like a regular flat video.</p>

<p>If you own an iPhone 15 Pro, there’s no good reason not to start capturing spatial videos this year — like, say, this holiday season — to record any sort of moments that feel like something you might want to experience as “memories” with a Vision headset in the future, even if you don’t plan to buy the first-generation Vision Pro next year.</p>

<h2>Viewing Spatial Video on Vision Pro</h2>

<p>Before my demo, I provided Apple with my eyeglasses prescription, and the Vision Pro headset I used had appropriate corrective lenses in place. As with my demo back in June, everything I saw through the headset looked incredibly sharp.</p>

<p>Apple has improved and streamlined the onboarding/calibration process significantly since June. There are a few steps where you’re presented with a series of dots in a big circle floating in front of you, like the hour indexes on a clock. As you look at each circle, it lights up a bit, and you do the finger tap gesture. It’s the Vision Pro’s way to calibrate that what it thinks you’re looking is what you actually are looking at. Once that calibration step was over — and it took just a minute or two — I was in, ready to go on the home screen of VisionOS. (And the precision of this calibration is amazing — UI elements can be placed relatively close to each other and it knows exactly which one you’re looking at when you tap. iOS UI design needs to be much more forgiving of our relatively fat fingertips than VisionOS UI design needs to be about the precision of our gaze.)</p>

<p>My demo yesterday was expressly limited to photography in general, and spatial video in particular, and so my demo was, per Apple’s request, limited to the Photos app in VisionOS. It was tempting, at times, to see where else I could go and what else I could do. But there was so much to see and do in Photos alone that my demo — about 30 minutes in total wearing Vision Pro — raced by.</p>

<p>Prior to separating us in smaller rooms for our time using Vision Pro, I was paired with Joanna Stern from The Wall Street Journal for a briefing on the details of spatial video capturing using the iPhones 15 Pro. We were each provided with a demo iPhone, and were allowed to capture our own spatial videos. We were in a spacious modern high-ceiling’d kitchen, bathed in natural light from large windows. A chef was busy preparing forms of sushi, and served as a model for us to shoot. Joanna and I also, of course, shot footage of each other, while we shot each other. It was very meta. The footage we captured ourselves was then preloaded onto the respective Vision Pro headsets we used for our demos.</p>

<p>We were not permitted to capture spatial video on Vision Pro.<sup id="fnr3-2023-11-10"><a href="#fn3-2023-11-10">3</a></sup> However, our demo units had one video in the Photos library that was captured on Vision Pro — a video I had experienced before, back in June, of a group of twenty-somethings sitting around a fire pit at night, having fun in a chill atmosphere. There were also several other shot-by-Apple spatial videos which were captured using an iPhone 15 Pro.</p>

<p>One obvious question: How different do spatial videos captured using iPhone 15 Pro look from those captured using a Vision Pro itself? Given that Apple provided only one example spatial video captured on Vision Pro, I don’t feel like I can fully answer that based on my experience yesterday. It did not seem like the differences were dramatic or significant. The spatial videos shot using iPhone 15 Pro that I experienced, including those I captured myself, seemed every bit as remarkable as the one captured using Vision Pro.</p>

<p>Apple won’t come right out and say it but I do get the feeling that all things considered, spatial video captured using Vision Pro will be “better”. The iPhone might win out on image quality, given the fact that the 1× main camera on the iPhone 15 Pro is the single best camera system Apple makes, but the Vision Pro should win out on spatiality — <em>3D-ness</em> — because Vision Pro’s two lenses for spatial video capture are roughly as far apart from each other as human eyes. The two lenses used for capture on an iPhone are, of course, much closer to each other than any pair of human eyes. But despite how close the two lenses are to each other, the 3D effect is <em>very</em> compelling on spatial video captured on an iPhone. It’s somehow simultaneously very natural-looking and utterly uncanny.</p>

<p>It’s a stunning effect and remarkable experience to watch them. And so the iPhone, overall, is going to win out as the “best” capture device for spatial video — even if footage captured on Vision Pro is technically superior — because, as the old adage states, the best camera is the one you have with you. I have my iPhone with me almost everywhere. That will never be even close to true for Vision Pro next year.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/first_impressions_of_vision_pro_and_visionos">Here’s what I wrote about spatial video back in June, after my first hands-on time with Vision Pro</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spatial photos and videos — photos and videos shot with the 
Vision Pro itself — are viewed as a sort of hybrid between 2D 
content and fully immersive 3D content. They don’t appear in a 
crisply defined rectangle. Rather, they appear with a hazy 
dream-like border around them. Like some sort of teleportation 
magic spell in a Harry Potter movie or something. The effect 
reminded me very much of Steven Spielberg’s <em>Minority Report</em>, in 
the way that Tom Cruise’s character <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@tcook/110509376936866896">could obsessively watch 
“memories” of his son</a>, and the way the psychic “precogs” 
perceive their visions of murders about to occur. It’s like 
watching a dream, but through a portal opened into another world. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you watch regular (non-spatial) videos using Vision Pro, or view regular still photography, the image appears in a crisply defined window in front of you. Spatial videos don’t appear like that at all. I can’t describe it any better today than I did in June: it’s like watching — and listening to — a dream, through a hazy-bordered portal opened into another world.</p>

<p>Several factors contribute to that dream-like feel. Spatial videos don’t look <em>real</em>. It doesn’t look or feel like the subjects are truly there in front of you. That <em>is</em> true of the live pass-through video you see in Vision Pro, of the actual real world around you. That pass-through video of actual reality is so compelling, so realistic, that in both my demo experiences to date I forgot that I was always looking at video on screens in front of my eyes, not just looking through a pair of goggles with my eyes’ own view of the world around me.</p>

<p>So Vision Pro is capable of presenting video that looks utterly real — because that’s exactly how pass-through video works and feels. Recorded spatial videos are different. For one thing, reality is not 30 fps, nor is it only 1080p. This makes spatial videos not look low-resolution or crude, per se, but rather more like movies. The upscaled 1080p imagery comes across as film-like grain, and the obviously-lower-than-reality frame rate conveys a movie-like feel as well. Higher resolution would look better, sure, but I’m not sure a higher frame rate would. Part of the magic of movies and TV is that 24 and 30 fps footage has a dream-like aspect to it.</p>

<p>Nothing you’ve ever viewed on a screen, however, can prepare you for the experience of watching these spatial videos, especially the ones you will have shot yourself, of your own family and friends. They truly are more like memories than videos. The spatial videos I experienced yesterday that were shot by Apple looked <em>better</em> — framed by professional photographers, and featuring professional actors. But the ones I shot myself were more compelling, and took my breath away. There’s my friend, Joanna, right in front of me — like I could reach out and touch her — but that was 30 minutes ago, in a different room.</p>

<p>Prepare to be moved, emotionally, when you experience this.</p>

<h2>Panoramic and Still Photos</h2>

<p>My briefing and demo experience yesterday was primarily about capturing spatial video on iPhone 15 Pro and watching it on Vision Pro, but my demo went through the entire Photos app experience in VisionOS.</p>

<p>Plain old still photos look <em>amazing</em>. You can resize the virtual window in which you’re viewing photos to as large as you can practically desire. It’s not merely like having a 20-foot display — a size far more akin to that of a movie theater screen than a television. It’s like having a 20-foot display with retina quality resolution, and the best brightness and clarity of any display you’ve ever used. I spend so much time looking at my own iPhone-captured still photos on my iPhone display that it’s hard to believe how good they can look blown up to billboard-like dimensions. Just plain still photos, captured using an iPhone.</p>

<p>And then there are panoramic photos. Apple first introduced Pano mode back in 2012, with the introduction of the iPhone 5. That feature has never struck me as better than “Kind of a cool trick”. In the decade since the feature has been available, I’ve only taken about 200 of them. They just look too unnatural, too optically distorted, when viewed on a flat display. And the more panoramic you make them, the more unnatural they look when viewed flat.</p>

<p>Panoramic photos viewed using Vision Pro are breathtaking.</p>

<p>There is no optical distortion at all, no fish-eye look. It just looks like you’re standing at the place where the panoramic photo was taken — and the wider the panoramic view at capture, the more compelling the playback experience is. It’s incredible, and now I wish I’d spent the last 10 years taking way more of them.</p>

<p>As a basic rule, going forward, I plan to capture spatial videos of <em>people</em>, especially my family and dearest friends, and panoramic photos of <em>places</em> I visit. It’s like teleportation.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Observations</h2>

<p>The Vision Pro experience is highly dependent upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveated_rendering">foveated rendering</a>, which Wikipedia succinctly describes as “a rendering technique which uses an eye tracker integrated with a virtual reality headset to reduce the rendering workload by greatly reducing the image quality in the peripheral vision (outside of the zone gazed by the fovea).” Our retinas work like this too — we really only see crisply what falls on the maculas at the center of our retinas. Vision Pro really only renders at high resolution what we are directly staring at. The rest is lower-resolution, but that’s not a problem, because when you shift your gaze, Vision Pro is extraordinarily fast at updating the display.</p>

<p>I noticed yesterday that if I darted my eyes from one side to the other fast enough, I could sort of catch it updating the foveation. Just for the briefest of moments, you can catch something at less than perfect resolution. I think. It is so fast fast fast at tracking your gaze and updating the displays that I can’t be sure. It’s just incredible, though, how detailed and high resolution the overall effect is. My demo yesterday was limited to the Photos app, but I came away more confident than ever that Vision Pro is going to be a great device for reading and writing — and thus, well, <em>work</em>.</p>

<p>The sound quality of the speakers in the headset strap is impressive. The visual experience of Vision Pro is so striking — I mean, the product has “Vision” in its name for a reason — that the audio experience is easy to overlook, but it’s remarkably good.</p>

<p>Navigating VisionOS with your gaze and finger taps is so natural. I’ve spent a grand total of about an hour, spread across two 30-minute demos, using Vision Pro, but I already feel at home using the OS. It’s an incredibly natural interaction model based simply on what you are looking at. My enthusiasm for this platform, and the future of spatial computing, could not be higher.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Vision Pro, Spatial Video, and Panoramic Photos’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/11/vision_pro_spatial_video_and_panoramic_photos">&#9733;</a></p>

<p>Filipe Espósito, with a nice scoop for 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By analyzing the new API, we’ve learned that it has an extension 
endpoint declared in the system, which means that other apps can 
create extensions of this type. Digging even further, we found a 
new, unused entitlement that will give third-party apps permission 
to install other apps. In other words, this would allow developers 
to create their own app stores. </p>

<p>The API has basic controls for downloading, installing, and even 
updating apps from external sources. It can also check whether an 
app is compatible with a specific device or iOS version, which the 
App Store already does. Again, this could easily be used to 
modernize MDM solutions, but here’s another thing. </p>

<p>We also found references to a region lock in this API, which 
suggests that Apple could restrict it to specific countries. This 
wouldn’t make sense for MDM solutions, but it does make sense for 
enabling sideloading in particular countries only when required by 
authorities — such as in the European Union. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Makes sense. If Apple winds up being forced to allow sideloading in the EU, I think they will <em>only</em> allow it in the EU. Apple still has a pending appeal, but I doubt they’ll win, and the deadline for compliance is March of next year, which probably means iOS 17.3 or 17.4.</p>

<p>New episodes usually drop at the crack of dawn, but today’s Dithering was held until 10am PT/1pm ET due to an embargo. Yesterday I got hands-on experience shooting spatial video using an iPhone 15 Pro and watching those videos that I shot — along with others, recorded by Apple — on a Vision Pro headset. I’m blown away once again. I’ll have a column describing my experience out later this afternoon, but Dithering subscribers can hear my thoughts now.</p>

<p>Dithering as a standalone subscription costs just $5/month or $50/year. You get two episodes per week, each exactly 15 minutes long. You can also get it as part of my co-host Ben Thompson’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/stratechery-plus/">Stratechery Plus bundle</a> — a veritable steal at just $12/month or $120/year. I just love having an outlet like Dithering for weeks like this one. People who try Dithering seem to love it, too — we have remarkably little churn.</p>

<p>Juli Clover, MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second beta of iOS 17.2 adds a new feature that allows an iPhone 15 Pro or ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max to record Spatial Video that can be viewed in the Photos app on Apple’s forthcoming Apple Vision Pro headset.</p>

<p>Spatial Video recording can be enabled by going to the Settings app, tapping into the Camera section, selecting Formats, and toggling on “Spatial Video for ‌Apple Vision Pro‌.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s off by default, but I think will be <em>on</em> by default in the future, if you have a Vision headset associated with your iCloud account. When enabled, you get an extra button in the viewfinder area of the Camera app when you’re in Video mode, similar to the Macro toggle or the toggle for Action mode. Very simple. Spatial videos captured on an iPhone are always and only 1080p / 30fps. And when you view them on a normal screen — i.e. any device other than a Vision headset — they just look like regular 1080p videos.</p>

  <p>Humane has been teasing its first device, the AI Pin, for most of this year. It’s scheduled to launch the Pin on Thursday, but The Verge has obtained documents detailing practically everything about the device ahead of its official launch. What they show is that Humane, the company noisily promoting a world after smartphones, is about to launch what amounts to a $699 wearable smartphone without a screen that has a $24 a month subscription fee, and which runs on a Humane-branded version of T-Mobile’s network with access to AI models from Microsoft and OpenAI.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today Apple announced updates to Final Cut Pro across Mac and 
iPad, offering powerful new features that help streamline 
workflows. Final Cut Pro now includes improvements in timeline 
navigation and organization, as well as new ways to simplify 
complex edits. The apps leverage the power-efficient performance 
of Apple silicon along with an all-new machine learning model for 
Object Tracker, and export speeds are turbocharged on Mac models 
powered by multiple media engines. Final Cut Pro for iPad brings 
new features to further enhance the portable Multi-Touch editing 
experience, including support for voiceover recording, expanded 
in-app content options, added color-grading presets, and workflow 
improvements. These updates to Final Cut Pro will be available 
later this month on the App Store. </p>

<p>It occurred to me then that the best evidence that Apple remains keenly committed to Final Cut Pro is that they (finally?) ported it, along with Logic Pro, to the iPad <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/09/final-cut-pro-logic-pro-ipad">earlier this year</a> — and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/17/snell-final-cut-logic-ipad">that the iPad versions are good</a>.</p>

</dt>
<dd>
<p>Earlier today I was making a screen recording on my iPhone to share with a friend, and during the recording, a notification for a text message arrived. It wasn’t particularly personal, but I made another take of the screen recording anyway. This has happened to me numerous times before — sort of a Murphy’s Law thing, like buttered toast always seeming to fall wrong-side down. It occurred to me that Do Not Disturb should turn on automatically when you’re recording your screen, and I posted the idea to Mastodon.</p>

<p>Glad I did. Because <a href="https://social.panic.com/@cabel/111370655233510063">Cabel Sasser replied</a> that it already worked like that for him, and then Jason Walke — my favorite person in the world today — <a href="https://social.lol/@jwalke/111370698605974156">explained that this is enabled by turning on “Smart Activation” for Do Not Disturb mode</a>.</p>

<p>Go to Settings → Focus → Do Not Disturb, and under “Set a Schedule”, tap Add Schedule and enable Smart Activation. Now, when you start a screen recording, Do Not Disturb turns on automatically, and it turns itself off a few seconds after you finish recording. I’m not sure what else triggers Smart Activation — the description in Settings is pretty vague — but for screen recordings this is just what I wanted.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://mastodon.social/@rjj/111370303568327667">Ryan Jones chimed in with a good idea</a>: an option to automatically beautify the status bar in screen recordings: removing any extraneous icons (like the Do Not Disturb moon), showing perfect cellular and Wi-Fi signal strength, and having the battery show 100 percent. “Presenter Mode” more or less.)</p>

<p>Isaac Arnsdorf, Josh Dawsey, and Devlin Barrett, reporting Sunday for The Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donald Trump and his allies have begun mapping out specific plans 
for using the federal government to punish critics and opponents 
should he win a second term, with the former president naming 
individuals he wants to investigate or prosecute and his 
associates drafting plans to potentially invoke the Insurrection 
Act on his first day in office to allow him to deploy the military 
against civil demonstrations. </p>

<p>In private, Trump has told advisers and friends in recent months 
that he wants the Justice Department to investigate onetime 
officials and allies who have become critical of his time in 
office, including his former chief of staff, John F. Kelly, and 
former attorney general William P. Barr, as well as his 
ex-attorney Ty Cobb and former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. 
Mark A. Milley, according to people who have talked to him, who, 
like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe 
private conversations. Trump has also talked of prosecuting 
officials at the FBI and Justice Department, a person familiar 
with the matter said. </p>

<p>In public, Trump has vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to “go 
after” President Biden and his family. The former president has 
frequently made corruption accusations against them that are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/09/07/trump-biden-false-attacks-2024-presidential-race/">not 
supported by available 
evidence</a>. </p>

<p>To facilitate Trump’s ability to direct Justice Department 
actions, his associates have been drafting plans to dispense with 
50 years of policy and practice intended to shield criminal 
prosecutions from political considerations. Critics have called 
such ideas dangerous and unconstitutional. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump and his supporters remain the biggest threat to America, and to the concept of liberal democracy itself, the world has ever seen. These are plans for a dictatorship, pure and simple.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/11/trump-plot-military-election/675922/">Tom Nichols, writing at The Atlantic</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trump is, to put it mildly, an emotionally disordered man. But 
such men are usually only a hazard to their families and 
themselves, especially if they lack money or power. Trump has 
both, but even more important, he has people around him willing to 
use that money and power against American democracy. As the Post 
report reveals, these henchmen are now trying to turn Trump’s 
ravings into an autocratic program; without their aid, Trump would 
be just another motormouthed New York executive living on 
inherited money and holding court over a charred steak while the 
restaurant staff roll their eyes. With their support, however, he 
is an ongoing menace to the entire democratic order of the United 
States. [...] </p>

<p>The coalition of prodemocracy voters — I am one of them — is 
shocked at the relative lack of outrage when Trump says hideous 
things. (The media’s complacency is a big part of this problem, 
but that’s a subject for another day.) For many of us, it feels as 
if Trump put up a billboard in Times Square that says “I will end 
democracy and I will in fact shoot you in the middle of Fifth 
Avenue if that’s what it takes to stay in power” and no one 
noticed. </p>

  <p>I’m not the first person to be saved by paramedics alerted by an

complaints of emergency workers inconvenienced by false alert 
calls related to events <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/10/09/rollercoaster-repeatedly-triggers-iphone-14s-crash-detection">including roller coasters</a>, where 
the user didn’t cancel the emergency call in time. </p>

<p>But I literally have some skin in the game with this new feature 
because Crash Detection called in an emergency response for me as 
I was unconscious and bleeding on the sidewalk, alone and late at 
night. According to calls it made, I was picked up and on my way 
to an emergency room within half an hour. </p>

<p>Because my accident occurred in a potentially dangerous and 
somewhat secluded area, I would likely have bled to death if the 
call hadn’t been automatically placed. </p>

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2023 fourth 
quarter ended September 30, 2023. The Company posted quarterly 
revenue of $89.5 billion, down 1 percent year over year, and 
quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.46, up 13 percent year 
over year. </p>

<p>“Today Apple is pleased to report a September quarter revenue 
record for iPhone and an all-time revenue record in Services,”

<p>From <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/fy2023-q4/FY23_Q4_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf">Apple’s financial statement</a> (PDF, figures are in millions of dollars):</p>

<p>Mac sales are down quite a bit year over year, both on a quarterly basis and trailing 12-month period, but I don’t think that’s a reflection on the Mac platform. Rather, it’s the whole PC market, which is now in a downswing after a huge surge during the early COVID years.</p>

<p>Services, at $22.3 billion, is now just over half the net sales for iPhone ($43.8 billion). And Mac + iPad + Wearables/etc. combine for $23.3 billion, so Services seems on the cusp of soon eclipsing all non-iPhone hardware combined.</p>

<p>Jess Weatherbed, writing for The Verge under the headline “Here’s What Apple Really Means When It Says ‘Shot on iPhone’”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a neat way to promote the recording quality of iPhone 
cameras, but it’s not like everyday folks can recreate these kinds 
of results at home unless they happen to own a shedload of 
ludicrously expensive equipment. The gear shown in the “Scary 
Fast” behind-the-scenes footage is fairly standard for big studio 
productions, but Apple’s implication with these so-called “shot on 
iPhone” promotions is that anyone can do it if only they buy the 
newest iPhone. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I saw a few folks mocking Apple for this on Mastodon and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blakersdozen/post/CzENNTQAD6G/">Threads</a>, too. This is ridiculous. Do these people think that previous Apple keynote films were shot with just a single camera person wielding something like a $40K RED cinema camera and no crew, no lighting, no cranes? That the iPhone “needs help” that traditional cinema cameras do not? I mean, guess what, they used professional microphones too.</p>

<p>Apple occasionally points out that they make all their software — iOS, MacOS, Safari and Webkit, Final Cut, the iWork suite, Photos and Camera … all of it — using Xcode, Swift, Objective-C, and the AppKit, UIKit, and SwiftUI frameworks that they offer free of charge to all developers. Pissing all over Apple for using expensive production sets for their keynote shoots while promoting the fact that they shot it using iPhone cameras is like pissing on Apple’s developer offerings because a lone developer or small team couldn’t create an entire operating system or non-linear professional video editing system.</p>

<p>The whole point is that an iPhone 15 Pro camera is so good that it can fit right in on a high-budget commercial film shoot, and produce world-class results. There’s no implication that a casual user can get results like this by just hitting the shutter button in the iPhone Camera app. That’s why Apple made an entire <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/31/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast">behind-the-scenes documentary</a>! To show us what it takes to make something look this good.</p>

<p>Why be so cynical? What Apple has accomplished here is extraordinary. They shot a 30-minute film using the same phone cameras they sell to hundreds of millions of people around the world, and the footage looked so good that <em>no one could tell it was shot using iPhones until they told us so</em>.</p>

<p>This is Apple at its best: they make tools for us, using those very same tools themselves. </p>

  <p>Our expectations for software are different from other products we 
use in our daily lives. </p>

<p>When we buy a physical product, we accept that it won’t change in 
its lifetime. We’ll use it until it wears off, and we replace it. 
We can rely on that product not evolving; the gas pedal in my car 
will always be in the same place. </p>

<p>However, when it comes to software, we usually have the ingrained 
expectations of perpetual updates. We believe that if software 
doesn’t evolve it’ll be boring, old and unusable. If we see an 
app with no updates in the last year, we think the creator might 
be dead. </p>

<p>Peter Coy, in a subscriber-only column for The New York Times (I’m using a gift sharing link, which I hope works for all of you):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. sells a lot of smart watches during the holidays, but 
this year its sales of most Apple Watch models may well drop 100 
percent — to literally zero — the day after Christmas. </p>

<p>That’s because of a <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/system/files?file=secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1276_notice10262023sgl.pdf">ruling</a> Thursday by the International 
Trade Commission that most Apple Watches contain parts that 
infringe on patents held by Masimo Corp., a producer of medical 
technology, and its sister company, Cercacor Laboratories Inc., 
both of Irvine, Calif. An import ban and a cease-and-desist order 
on sales both take effect on Dec. 26 — unless President Biden 
reverses the decision by Dec. 25, which appears unlikely. 
(Presidents <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-trade-tribunal-issues-potential-apple-watch-import-ban-masimo-patent-fight-2023-10-26/">rarely</a> overrule the <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/">independent, nonpartisan 
agency</a>, which was <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub0000.pdf">founded</a> in 1916 as the U.S. 
Tariff Commission.) [...]</p>

<p>Apple declined to provide an executive to speak on the record. The 
company’s position is that Masimo is pursuing a strategy of 
litigation over innovation, hoping to generate a fresh stream of 
royalties because royalties from past litigation have dried up. 
Apple points out that the federal jury that deadlocked in May was 
6-to-1 for Apple, indicating that Masimo was a long way from 
making its case. </p>

<p>This fight is far from over. “My goal isn’t just to beat Apple,” 
Kiani told me in an interview last summer. “It’s to get Apple to 
change its ways.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way or another, I expect Apple Watch to remain available for sale in the U.S. But that deadline is just two months away.</p>

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Monday, October 30, at Apple’s Scary Fast special event 
unveiling the all-new MacBook Pro with the M3 family of chips and 
24-inch iMac with M3, there was an unseen star of the show working 
behind the scenes. All of the presenters, locations, and drone 
footage in the event were filmed using iPhone 15 Pro Max, the 
preferred smartphone for creative pros and filmmakers. Led by 
documentary film director Brian Oakes, known for the award-winning 
<em>Jim: The James Foley Story</em> and <em>Living with Lincoln</em>, Scary Fast 
put iPhone 15 Pro Max right in the middle of the action. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I noticed <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/10/shot-on-iphone.jpeg">the credit at the end of the video</a> last night: “This event was shot on iPhone and edited on Mac”, but until I saw that, I never would have guessed that the video was shot on iPhones. It looked every bit as good as Apple’s previous pre-recorded keynotes, which presumably were shot on dedicated professional digital film cameras. To my eyes Apple didn’t sacrifice an iota of image quality.</p>

<p>Even better, the behind-the-scenes documentary is fascinating. Given their cinematic quality, I’ve always assumed these videos were major productions behind the scenes, but now we can <em>see</em> it — everything from lighting, directing, cinematography, sound, set design, talent, crew, editing, color grading — every single aspect of these keynotes aspires to the highest levels of production quality. Not merely “<em>this looks and sounds good for a marketing video</em>”, but “<em>this looks and sounds good for a movie</em>”.</p>

<p>It’s impressive what the iPhone 15 Pro camera is capable of. And it’s really fun that Apple finally took us behind the scenes of one of these keynotes.</p>

<p>Alan Sepinwall, writing for Rolling Stone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s not a lot of Matthew Perry in the pilot episode of 
<em>Friends</em>, but he gets to deliver one of its funniest jokes. As 
the gang sits around Central Perk, a newly-divorced Ross admits 
that he just wants to be married again. A second later, Rachel 
wanders into the coffee shop, soaking wet and wearing a wedding 
dress. Without missing a beat, Perry’s Chandler Bing declares, 
“And I just want a million dollars!” </p>

<p>Like a lot of Chandler punchlines, it’s quick and biting in its 
sarcasm. And like a lot of Chandler punchlines, Perry’s delivery 
elevates it from a smartass quip that a few dozen actors could say 
into something you can’t imagine leaving anyone else’s mouth. </p>

<p>Note the timing and the emphasis of the thing. The pause after 
“And I,” the way he hits the “I” as hard as he does, and the way 
his voice goes full game show host as he says “million dollars,” 
all combine to give the gag a musicality beyond what <em>Friends</em> 
creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane wrote on the page. It’s a 
small moment in an episode that is primarily concerned with 
characters who are not Chandler Bing. But you watch it and you 
want to hear him say things like it, again and again and again. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perry was so great on <em>Friends</em>, but my favorite show he was on was the short-lived <em><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/studio-60-on-the-sunset-strip/umc.cmc.2shyb7anow8v1rlv12c6lsx7v">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a></em>, a 2006 Aaron Sorkin show that I’ve always thought failed in part<sup>*</sup> because it was a few years ahead of its time. Its lone 22-episode season aired on NBC. It was too smart, too cinematic, for network TV. It should have been on a cable channel like HBO, or, if it aired a decade later, a streaming service. The show was so good (at times — 22 episodes was way too many for a show striving for such quality), and Perry was sublime.</p>

<p>Perry, too, deserves accolades for his remarkable openness regarding his long struggle with addiction, and his heartfelt willingness to help anyone and everyone  else with The Problem. Rest in peace.</p>

<p><small>* I don’t know if it hurt <em>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</em>, but another weird thing about it was that it debuted the same year, on the same network, as Tina Fey’s hall-of-fame-funny sitcom <em><a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/tv/30-rock/6240863759978157112">30 Rock</a></em>. Both shows shared the same fundamental premise: they were about fictionalized versions of <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. They even both had numbers in their titles, and those numbers were oddly similar. <em>Studio 60</em> was a funny drama, and <em>30 Rock</em> a sitcom’s sitcom, but I always wondered if it was a bad idea to launch two <em>roman a clefs</em> about <em>SNL</em> at the same time.</small></p>

<p>Alexis Soloski, writing for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A confession: When I received a news alert that the actor Matthew 
Perry had died, my mind adopted the particular cadence that Perry 
perfected as Chandler Bing, the character he played for 10 seasons 
on the NBC sitcom <em>Friends</em>. Here is what I thought, “Could this 
<em>be</em> any sadder?” </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/arts/television/matthew-perry-dead.html">Perry, 54, died</a> nearly a year after the publication of 
<em><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250866448/friendsloversandthebigterriblething">Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</a></em>, an unusually 
candid memoir of addiction and recovery. As he detailed in that 
book, he spent many of the best years of his career oblivious, 
avoidant, numb — conditions that don’t typically encourage great 
acting. But he was great. And it had seemed reasonable, if 
rose-colored, to hope that sobriety might make him better, 
returning him to the nervy, instinctive brilliance of his peak 
years. That hope is now foreclosed. [...] </p>

<p>To say that he never did anything quite as good as <em>Friends</em>, 
before or after, is not to diminish his achievement. Even among 
the irrepressible talents of his co-stars, Perry stood out, for a 
rubbery, heedless way with physical comedy and a split-second 
timing that most stopwatches would envy. If you have seen more 
than a few episodes of the show — and many, many millions have, 
including fans born years after its initial airing — you will 
have absorbed Chandler’s rhythms, his catchphrases, the way 
Perry’s handsome, moony face would stretch like spandex, the 
better to sell a reaction. He had both an absolute commitment to 
what a line required and a way of gently ironizing that line. His 
character was the butt of jokes. Perry was in on those same jokes. 
There was a boyishness to him that seemed to excuse his 
characters’ worst behavior, on <em>Friends</em> and in subsequent roles. </p>

<p>Jacob Kastrenakes and Alex Heath, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Elon Musk wants X to be the center of your financial world, 
handling anything in your life that deals with money. He expects 
those features to launch by the end of 2024, he told X employees 
during an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23698094">all-hands call on Thursday</a>, saying that people 
will be surprised with “just how powerful it is.” </p>

<p>“When I say payments, I actually mean someone’s entire financial 
life,” Musk said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by 
The Verge. “If it involves money. It’ll be on our platform. 
Money or securities or whatever. So, it’s not just like send $20 
to my friend. I’m talking about, like, you won’t need a bank 
account.” </p>

<p>X CEO Linda Yaccarino said the company sees this becoming a “full 
opportunity” in 2024. “It would blow my mind if we don’t have that 
rolled out by the end of next year,” Musk said. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a day goes by that I don’t hear from someone who wishes that the entirety of their personal finances were handled by a company with the reputation for reliability of X.</p>

<p>It’s so obvious, and banking systems are so easy, I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if X launches this by April 20, even.</p>
