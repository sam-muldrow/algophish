        A retired dog walker was bequeathed a painting by an artist whose works sell for millions - but got a nasty shock when he auctioned it for what he hoped would be $10 million. Mark Herman, 68, was given the abstract work by Chuck Close by his friend and former customer, Isidore Silver, a retired lawyer. Silver, 87, had represented Close in a high profile First Amendment case against the University of Massachusetts in the 1960s, after the institution tried to ban him from displaying nude content as part of an exhibition of his work. He was given the abstract nude by his former client and bequeathed it to Herman in his final days, after the two became good friends when Herman begun working as a dog walker for his beloved toy Poodle. Other works by Close have fetched as much $4.8 million at auction and following a months long struggle to prove the painting's authenticity, Herman finally seemed poised to scoop a major payout. But sadly, it wasn't to be.

      Israel and Hamas have reportedly agreed to a five-day pause in fighting to free hostages from Gaza in exchange for a five-day pause in fighting. As part of the detailed, six-page agreement, all parties would freeze combat operations for at least five days while 'an initial 50 or more hostages are released in smaller groups every 24 hours', the Washington Post reported. Hamas took about 240 hostages during its October 7 rampage inside Israel that killed 1,200 people. But early on Sunday morning in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied that any such deal was in place. Netanyahu said 'as of now' there no deal had yet been reached to secure the release hostages being held by Hamas dismissing 'a lot of incorrect reports' about imminent agreements.

        Both widowers, Doris Kriks and Carl Kruse's story is not conventional, but touching nonetheless - and shows how, at times, rivalry can lead to something romantic.

       A group of up to 20 people, which included young children, were seen sleeping underneath blankets on benches on Friday. The migrants arrived in Boston as the Massachusetts shelter cap reached its maximum and there is deadlock over how best to spend $250million for emergency shelters. They have been put on a waiting list after the state's system for emergency accommodation hit a cap of 7,500 families last week.

        As interest rates hover at 22-year highs amid lingering inflation, the luxury surge seems to be slowing - and bringing down the value of items with it.

       Forty years ago, it was a condition that most people hadn't heard of, and few understood. Karen, then 31, was instantly defensive. 'No, I was just pooped... tired out,' she protested. Her brother, sitting by her side, hastily stepped in. He called a halt to filming, claiming that Karen's eating issues were in the past. When the interview re-started, there was no mention of Karen's weight or her gaunt appearance. Sixteen months later, Karen was dead. Her death, an inquest later recorded, was due to heart failure as a consquence of anorexia.

                David Axelrod shared his analysis on the poll, published on November 5 by The New York Times and Siena College, which showed the president, 80, behind Trump in five of six key battleground states . He claimed the data 'will send tremors of doubt thru the [Democratic] Party' and added that Biden needs to decide whether running in the 2024 presidential race is in his or the country's best interests. Axelrod added that the 'stakes of miscalculation here are too dramatic to ignore,' characterizing Trump as a 'dangerous, unhinged demagogue whose brazen disdain for the rules, norms, laws and institutions or democracy should be disqualifying.'

                There is an old saying in Hollywood that you are only as good as your last hit.  So when Meghan Markle made a triumphant return to the red carpet last week at the prestigious Power Of Women gala, alongside stars such as Margot Robbie, Carey Mulligan and Leo DiCaprio, the significance was lost on no one. It has been nearly a year since the Sussexes' company, Archewell Productions, released the controversial six-part series, Harry & Meghan, on Netflix. The show covered their relationship from courtship to quitting as senior Royals, and remains Netflix's highest-rated documentary debut. But a year is a lifetime in Hollywood.

                A female boxer withdrew from a Canadian tournament after being told her rival is transgender, citing safety fears. Dr. Katia Bissonnette, from Saguenay, claims she was given just an hour's notice she was being matched with transgender fighter Mya Walmsley last month. The two had been due to face off in the 2023 Provincial Golden Glove Championship in Victoriaville, Quebec.

                The concerns, aired by a fellow OpenAI board member, culminated with the 38-year-old's sudden firing Friday - sending the tech world into a storm of speculation. Founded by Altman and ten others in 2015, OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT just about a year ago - and its ability to mimic human writing has proved polarizing ever since. Aside from sparking worry amongst the public, this uncertainty, was apparently also felt within OpenAI's six-person board, according to The New York Times - particularly by one of Altman's cofounders, Ilya Sutskever. In a series of interviews, people familiar with the matter spoke about how the AI researcher had become worried about OpenAI's budding technology prior to the firing, and shared a belief his boss was not paying enough attention to the risks. Those concerns came as many warned AI could one day result in a dystopian, machine-run landscape, as it did in James Cameron's famed Terminator series.

                Jennifer Lopez showed off her world-famous hips in a clinging dress while posing up a storm on Instagram this week. The 54-year-old pop star was decked out in a skintight ruched Magda Burtrym frock that threw her statuesque dancer's body into relief. Her figure-hugging ensemble featured tantalizingly translucent fabric and an intricate floral accent at the neckline.

                Essex District Attorney Paul F. Tucker made the revelation Friday, a little more than six months after Sidney Olson was struck on the streets of small-town Massachusetts. The family is still pursuing civil charges against the driver, who hit the child as she was walking to an art class with a relative in Andover on May 9. Relatives said she had the 'walk' signal, but that the driver missed the child when he moved forward when his light turned green. The often busy intersection gives pedestrians the right of way, but Essex District Attorney Paul F. Tucker on Friday said the girl's death was not the result of a criminal act.

                EXCLUSIVE: When Shareza Jackson reconnected with Dorian Wilkerson, she thought she had met the one, but the fairytale turned into a real-life nightmare - and left her $1.4million poorer. Jackson, 44, had known Wilkerson in high school so when he reached out to her on Facebook in 2014, fond memories of the good looking football and track star came flooding back. It seemed a perfect match: she was a regional director of a healthcare company in Florida, he was a doctor in Atlanta. Despite the distance, they began dating. He treated her like a princess, she was enamored. Six years after their wedding (pictured, main) and after she invested significant funds in his cosmetic medical center venture, she got suspicious. What she uncovered shocked her to her core.

                The homeowner of a stunning lakefront property in Akron, Ohio, teamed up with a pair of brilliant interior designers to make his '1920s-meets-Mad Men' vision for the house come to life. Now in his 60s, the property investor purchased the house in 2006 for $450,000 as a 'weekend getaway' location. One room in the home that needed extra attention was the library - which he described as having dated wall-to-wall carpeting and dingy plaster walls. So alongside his interior design team - they spent a total of $210k on the space to make it feel 'inviting and comfortable'.

        The glitz and glam of Las Vegas won't just be seen in the lights on the strip or the rich clientele in the stands - at least two of the drivers will take part in the theme as well.

                Jeff Bezos (pictured) has famously been working on trying to reverse the aging process - and if the latest images of the Amazon tycoon are anything to go by, his efforts are paying off. The 59-year-old businessman, alongside his glamorous fiance Lauren Sanchez, 53, (pictured, inset) recently appeared in a Vogue photoshoot. An image from the shoot attracted a huge amount of attention, with social media users commenting on Jeff's appearance, when it was shared on the magazine's Instagram platform. In the snap, the businessman - who is the third richest man in the world and has a reported net worth of $165 billion - is shown sitting in the front seat of a truck. Meanwhile, his partner Lauren wraps her arms around his neck as she sits on his lap, in a pose that shows off both of their impressive builds. Many Instagram users noticed Jeff's huge biceps in the photograph, with some even suggesting publication have retouched the images in an effort to make his arms look bigger. But what cannot be denied is that the mogul has made a major change to his overall appearance - and it is not computer generated.

       For the first time in my life, I'm terrified of my generation. For 22 years after nearly 3,000 Americans were murdered on 9/11, all it took was a social media fad to convince these Gen Z lemmings that the terrorist slaughter was justified. What else could they be persuaded to believe? I can only imagine the reaction of horrified Boomer parents who woke up Thursday to read about what their ne'er-do-well offspring were doing in the basement the night before. Many were watching TikToks praising one of humanity's most deranged mass killers and his infamous 'Letter to America.' Yes, I'm talking about terrorist Osama Bin Laden's screed of radical Islamist rantings, his feeble attempt to rationalize the 2001 murder of innocents by claiming that American foreign policy in Israel and around the Arab world brought on Al-Qaeda's attack. Views of the associated hashtag have topped a total of 12.5million, with some videos being 'liked' over 100,000 times. How could my peers stomach reading such gutter scum - let alone be moved by it?

                Diddy's former protégée Aubrey O'Day (right) is blasting him and the US justice system after the hip hop mogul settled his ex-girlfriend Cassie's (with Diddy left) lawsuit against him after just a single day. Diddy, whose real name is Sean Combs, was sued for $30 million and was accused of 'rape' and 'repeated physical abuse over about a decade' by the 37-year-old singer. No details of the settlement were released. , O'Day shared a screenshot (inset) of an article about Diddy settling the lawsuit while complaining about the influence of money on the 'system.' The singer is saying the system didn't work because Diddy likely shelled out money to end the lawsuit and the slew of bad press it was sure to bring him. The suit alleged how Diddy controlled and abused Cassie for over a decade - as well as plying her with drugs, beating her, and forcing her to have sex with multiple male prostitutes while he watched and recorded.

                Family members and supporters of some 240 hostages held in Gaza have protested in Jerusalem today (left and right) over Netanyahu's (inset) handling of the war with Hamas and pleaded with the government to do more to bring their loved ones home. The march capped a five-day trek from Tel Aviv and represented the largest protest on behalf of the hostages since they were dragged into Gaza by Hamas on October 7 as part of the militants' deadly attack in southern Israel. About 1,200 people were killed in Israel on the day of the surprise Hamas assault.

                What's your strategy to solving GuessWord?  In GuessWord, players have six chances to guess a five-letter word - but it could be one of thousands. The player's job is to whittle down that list as fast as possible and clever strategies can reduce the number of guesses and time they need to land on the solution.

       The perfect wedding day is of paramount importance to brides-to-be - from the most breathtaking venue, to the most enchanting decor, to the meticulously picked guests of friends and family. That is, until one may have the added misfortune of acquiring a particularly prickly mother-in-law, who wants only the 'best' for her son and has an unsolicited say in how the big day goes. In a video captured by a ceremony guest at a wedding in the U.S, a bride was left both red-faced and seeing red when her mother-in-law to-be berated her at the alter for humorously pointing out her fiancé's 'flaws' in a speech. The TikTok , which has since been deleted, was originally posted by the bride's sister, Sarah Ragsdale, from San José, California , in 2020.

On Friday the 13th in December 1991 in the small town of Federal Way, Washington, Sarah's parents said goodbye to their daughter and headed away for the weekend for her brother's soccer tournament - unknowing that it would be the last time they'd see the teenager. The next morning, she rushed out of her home with her curlers still in her hair so that she could make it on time to her drill team practice. But after she arrived at the school, Sarah, a 'talented, creative, and kind' honor student, was viciously strangled with her own stockings - and left in the bushes a stone's throw away from where her teammates were practicing. Despite multiple witnesses seeing a man standing over Sarah's body and a slew of DNA evidence being all over her clothes, it would be decades before detectives were able to close the case.

                A dog was found alone tied to a pole in the short-term parking garage at Pittsburgh International Airport. Just hours earlier the dog was walking through the airport with a man pushing a luggage cart, CCTV footage showed. 'There is no excuse for leaving your pets behind,' Allegheny County police said in a news release after the heartbreaking discovery. The suspected owner had the little dog - which appeared to be a chihuahua - walking alongside him on a leash as they made their way through the airport.

                America's Most Wanted fugitive, Donald Santini (pictured) who spent 40 years on the run, has been sentenced for the 1994 murder of Cynthia 'Cindy' Ruth Wood (center) that will see him die in prison. Santini, 65, was arrested in June in Southern California for strangling to death Cynthia 'Cindy' Ruth Wood, 33, in Bradenton, Florida in 1984. He appeared on America's Most Wanted three times - in 1990, 2005 and 2013 - and remained on the list until cops received a tip-off in June when he applied for a passport.

                New York City cancer patient Casey McIntyre (left) has posthumously raised enough money to erase millions of dollars in medical debt for other people after her husband (right) set up campaign. McIntyre, 38, died on November 12 after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2019.  The mother-of-one revealed her incredible act of charity in a pre-written social media post announcing her own death.

       Natasha, who has a TikTok following of nearly 10,000, claims she 'sweats' when she misses out on the fizzy pop. The TikToker alleged in a viral video that she has knocked back at least two litres of Pepsi daily for the last four years. 'I'm not joking, I'm not exaggerating,' she said in the clip, 'if you know me in real life you know this to be true.'

                In Sex and the City, Carrie Bradshaw's single life sometimes seemed like one long, frantic search for the right kind of relationship. While Carrie might have found what she was after, for those of us still waiting for our Mr Big, life may sometimes seem like a maze of pressure and social expectations. However, whether you're more of a Charlotte or a Miranda, Professor Peter McGraw (pictured bottom left), of the University of Colorado, says you can find fulfilment without finding a partner. Professor McGraw, a psychologist and behavioural economist, says he has identified four categories of singletons we can all find ourselves in.
