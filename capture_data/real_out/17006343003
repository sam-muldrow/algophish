		<br />

			Since 2005, our team is working 24/7/365 to maintain one of the World's largest resource center for webmasters and programmers. The idea is simple ... crawl, validate, format, trim and prioritize similar programming related issues on a single page from hundreds of resources over web. A time saver for overburdened programmers and also provides focused solutions to their problems.
			<br /><br />
			Every single step of indexing of resources being monitored by programming professionals. It tooks us 12 years to put together an index of 5 million plus qualified Q&As by humans, not bots.
			<br /><br />
		Just crawling and building a database of programming problems is not an art. The success of this unique project lies in the human editing of these messages by professionals for content validity and definitive solution. Compare and see the difference between an original post on a forum and the same edited message added to our index here. No unanswered posts, salutations, lengthy code lines, images, avatars, attachments, closing remarks, reference URLs, signatures etc., just the core issues and solutions to them. We ONLY index the issues/questions, to find a qualified solution, our visitors have to visit respective sites.
<br /><br />
As of Jan 2016 stats, 50,000 unique visitors/webmasters visit us every day to get benefited from this index. We are working hard and striving harder to provide programmers an unmatchable resource index to their unanswered questions. On average, 1000 messages per day are edited, validated and added to our index by a team of 18 members.
<br /><br />BigResource, always blammed for spamming and infriging copyrights by collecting and putting together content from other sources. Rest assured that this content is being added by due permission of respective sites. People say it SPAM, we say it an ART, resource the source.

        <span>Feb 10, 2016<br /></span>
        <p>I have a program group that contains a bunch of shortcuts. Some are applications. Some are shortcut links to web pages or web-based control panels. The problem is that ever since I upgraded to Windows 10, searching doesn&#039;t find the web shortcuts. <br /><br />For example, &quot;Password Generator&quot; is a desktop app and a shortcut to it appears in this program group. So I press the Windows key and type &quot;pass&quot; and &quot;Password Generator&quot; pops right up. &quot;Avast Cloud&quot; also appears in this program group, a shortcut for [URL] ....<br /><br />But when I hit the Windows key and type &quot;avast&quot; I get nothing. I can click through the &quot;All apps&quot; menu and it&#039;s there, but search can&#039;t find it. I have rebuilt the index, of course. But this behavior is very consistent and applies to all shortcuts that go to a URL. It means I spend extra time hunting things in the menu rather than pulling them right up with search.</p>

        <span>Oct 16, 2015<br /></span>
        <p>Recently I have noticed that my computer is EXTREMELY SLUGGISH after I wake it up out of sleep mode.  It runs very very slowly.  Rebooting is the only thing that fixes the sluggishness but then it happens again once my computer is put to sleep and then wakes up.<br /><br />My computer is an Alienware Area 51 R2. I upgraded to windows 10 about a month ago without any problems.  I have the Hibernate feature turned off as the files required to preserve my computer state during hibernation take up far too much space on my tiny 120 GB SSD that windows is installed on (all my games and other stuff are installed to the 1.5 TB standard platter-based hard drive)  Sleep function remains enabled though.<br /><br />I have a pair of NVIDIA Geforce GTX 980 graphics cards and am using the latest graphics drivers with them (358.50 according to the latest update i got). <br /><br />Defragmenting (and in the case of SSD, trimming it) have not worked.</p>

        <p>Are it and maximum processor state useful on a desktop, or is it just for laptops? Lower and Maximum are both set to 100% for me. I read that if I lower the minimum, my cpu doesn&#039;t reach the max overclock level.</p>

        <span>Aug 21, 2015<br /></span>
        <p>I am having to use a windwos 8.1 AMD graphics driver because the AMD HD6320 series graphics still has no updated driver from AMD to support windows 10. The video freezes and goes green with the HD6320 driver. The win 8.1 driver works great except windows 10 keep updating and reinstalling the standard driver for the HD6320. I haven&#039;t found a way to hide an update in windows 10 like I could in windows 7.</p>

        <span>Sep 11, 2015<br /></span>
        <p>I am having a problem with games freezing on my windows 10 pc. The games that have been freezing are GTA 3,  GTA Vice City, GTA San Andreas and Team Fortress 2. GTA V is working fine without any freezes. if i reboot my pc all games are working fine, the freezing usually happens when the pc have been on for a few hours and happens randomly. the games actually start but is really slow, i can skip the intro cutscenes but after that i cant do anything. I can Ctrl + Alt + Delete and close the games and the pc is working just fine its just the games that wont work. </p>
