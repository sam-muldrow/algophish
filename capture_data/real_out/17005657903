When the proclamation was published in other languages, “gender” became in French “le genre masculin ou féminin” and in Spanish “El ser hombre o el ser mujer” (being a man or being a woman). In Dutch, “gender” was translated by “geslacht” and in German by “Geslecht,” the word for biological sex, though “gender” exists in both languages. Similar choice in Italian: “il sesso” instead of “il genere.” For English, church leadership finally had to <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/10/02/dark-day-transgender/\">clarify in 2019</a> that “gender” in the proclamation is meant as “biological sex at birth,” much to the sorrow of those who saw a ray of hope in the term “gender.”"},{"level":2,"_id":"ODYGO36DFRESRDOBE6PLKEF6GA","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1700076697790},"type":"header","content":"Unnamed"},{"level":3,"_id":"DP7DT3K4GNDCTKLRJ5HOYLTD4Y","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1700076697791},"type":"header","content":"United Kingdom"},{"_id":"FP2PB7EGIVE75NSJJP5LFI55UY","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1700076697792},"type":"text","content":"<i>Born and raised in England, this interviewee moved to the United States nearly 10 years ago at age 32.

While it is seen as containing some important doctrinal points, such as the inclusion of everyone in God’s family and the preeminent role of families in society, it isn’t seen as a rigid directive for what families should look like or how they should function. Perhaps these things were viewed already as axiomatic by British members.
