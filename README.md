## Algophish
Algophish is a machine learning project that uses tensorflow to attempt to detect phising websites.

The pipeline works as follows:
- Data collection (downloading the source code of phishing and legitimate websites)
- Data preprocessing (removing bad data)
- Model training
- Model Analysis
